1984,"  uf812       LOUISVILLE, Ky., Dec. 24 - William J. Schroeder, the recipient of the world's second permanent artificial heart, would probably be leaving the hospital now if he had not suffered three strokes, his surgeon, Dr. William C. DeVries, said today.   And Mr. Schroeder probably would have been moved to a rehabilitation unit to help him recover from recent memory, speech and physical impairments he suffered as a result of the strokes, which were detected Dec. 13.   But because he is both an artificial heart and stroke patient, Mr. Schroeder will share a quiet Christmas dinner with his family at Humana Hospital-Audubon. At times he has been listening to Christmas carols from a recording in a teddy bear that has a heart that lights up.    Dr. DeVries and three other doctors on the medical team said at a news conference that they have no target date for his release from the hospital.

1985,"  THE Sunset Park section of Brooklyn is about five years into a revival propelled by the availability of relatively affordable housing. But people who drive quickly through the neighborhood may miss its new vitality.   From the elevated Gowanus Expressway, they may see only the spectacular skeletons of steel warehouses sagging into the waterfront, or, if they take a shortcut down Third or Fourth Avenue, they will see the sort of urban blight that ensues when city planners carve landscaped boulevards into 10-lane highways, as they did there decades ago.   Drivers may also notice the egg-shaped dome of St. Michael's Roman Catholic Church rising high above 42d Street and wonder how such an lovely landmark got lost in the wasteland.   The short answer is that the neighborhood rose and fell with its shipping industry. Questionable urban planning, rapid population changes, block-busting and housing abandonment also took their toll.   SUNSET PARK"

On Oct. 3, 1965, at the base of the statue, in the presence of members of Congress, other Government officials and representatives of voluntary agencies serving immigrants and refugees, President Lyndon B. Johnson signed into law the Immigration Act of 1965.   This legislation, first recommended by President Kennedy, finally eliminated the notorious national-origins quota system. That shameful law, signed by President Coolidge in 1924, deliberately discriminated against migrants from eastern and southern Europe and the Far East, because Congress considered them inferior to northern or western Europeans. The 1924 legislation had been further reinforced by the McCarran-Walter Act of 1952, which was passed over President Truman's veto. Immigration Policy in the Light of a New Torch"

1986,"  HIGH ART By Rubem Fonseca. Translated by Ellen Watson. 345 pp. New York: Harper & Row. $17.95.    THE mass media, print and video, stole their best tricks from literature. A few contemporary novelists are now returning the favor. The most celebrated example is Umberto Eco, whose ''Name of the Rose'' - a hybrid medieval thriller, adventure novel and erudite entertainment - proves that intelligence, learning and esthetic experimentation can be yoked with 19th-century feuilleton devices: suspense, digression, violence, outrageous coincidence and spectacular historical panoramas.   In Latin American literature, the writer Manuel Puig exemplifies this stealing from the mass media. Mr. Puig was inspired by cinema - as were Guillermo Cabrera Infante and, to a lesser degree, Carlos Fuentes. The author of ''Kiss of the Spider Woman,'' Mr. Puig found in films not only themes and an inexhaustible supply of myths but, more important, a narrative technique. Like screenplays, his books - simultaneously visual and spoken - make rapid jumps to the past and the future. Their cinematic allusions constitute a utopian alternative, a fantasy world where people can escape the degradation of their lives. THUGS WHO KNOW THEIR GREEK"

Its interior was typically ornate, with a patterned terrazzo floor, a six-foot-wide clock, and dolphin-shaped coffee spigots.     Because of its location just east of Carnegie Hall, this Automat, flagship of the Horn & Hardart chain, was popular with performers, would-be performers and nostalgic has-beens.

1984,"   Just when Prime Minister Indira Gandhi's political stock seemed to be rising as a result of her bold action in June against Sikh extremists in Punjab, the furor over the dismissal last month of N. T.  Rama Rao as the elected leader of the southern state of Andhra Pradesh appears to have sent it plummeting again.

1982,"  ONE handy solution when the programming pickings are slim is to put together a ''thematic'' package. So this week WNET-TV, Channel 13, is offering a series of programs as part of a package designed to salute the American worker. Tonight at 10 o'clock, ''Miles of Smiles, Years of Struggles,'' produced and directed by Jack Santino and Paul Wagner, offers a history of the Pullman porters, a group of workers who began forming themselves in the mid-1920's into the country's first black union.   The film is narrated by an extraordinary woman named Rosina Tucker, the widow of a Pullman porter. Mrs. Tucker, who was 100 years old when the film was made, last year, offers a charming combination of graceful elegance and sharp insights. She refers to her husband as Porter Tucker, to herself as Sister Tucker. avoiding the slightest hint of abrasiveness, she manages to establish hard truths, most notably that the grinning porter's supposedly warm relationship with his railway-car passengers came to an abrupt halt at journey's end because the ''servants'' were black and thus still second-class citizens.

1986,"  Shares of the GAF Corporation plunged $4, to $51.25, in heavy trading yesterday as Wall Street professionals grew increasingly uncertain that the roofing and chemicals producer would pursue its hostile $5 billion takeover battle for the Union Carbide Corporation.   Union Carbide stock, meanwhile, stood at $73.75, down only 25 cents, also in heavy trading, partly because of the company's special steps to support the market even if Samuel J. Heyman, chairman of GAF, drops out of the fight.   Several traders said that, if Mr. Heyman was planning to do something, he would have to do it by tomorrow morning, when advance trading will begin in bonds that Carbide is expected to issue in a few weeks.   The bonds are tailored to limit sales of company operations if anyone takes over the company. GAF has devised a plan to defuse the bond provisions, but its plan would be much harder to carry out once professionals began trading in the bonds because they would become widely disseminated. Even though GAF has offered to buy the bonds as a key part of its takeover offer, traders say that the price it is offering is not enough and that it will have to offer more.

Subsequently, the area was rezoned for high-rise residential use.

This is almost always a problem when you're grilling, broiling or deep-frying shrimp -- the most popular methods. But one technique that preserves the shrimp's essence is cooking it in liquid, and for shrimp there is no liquid like olive oil.    I'm not talking about sauteing, either. This is about cooking the shrimp a little more slowly, almost poaching or braising it, in oil to tease out its liquids. These juices then combine with the oil to create a powerful sauce that can easily be varied. The sauce is really the thing here -- most of the shrimp flavor is transferred to it. So you have to serve it with bread.   Flavor Baths For Shrimp"

But Ms. Tucker, a 60's idealist whom Newsweek named one of its ""people for the 90's,"" does not disguise her political convictions and artistic sympathies. She has just finished celebrating the 15th anniversary of the New Museum of Contemporary Art, which she founded ""to see what happens when you don't look at everything through white male eyes.""

In the museum's long, narrow, white-walled space on Broadway in lower Manhattan, she and her curators have mounted rambunctiously multicultural, aggressively multimedia exhibitions radiating social relevance. What has been a breath of fresh air to some observers has been a consciousness-raising tool from hell to others.

How such a reversal could so suddenly threaten the stability of Asia is a drama in which there are four players, each with its distinctive contribution to the crisis. The first is the Republican Congress, which has spawned the most energetic coalition ever assembled to openly confront China while the second player, the Clinton Administration, has sought ""engagement."" Congress has promoted independence for Taiwan and Tibet, and it proposes sanctions every time China is found wanting on human rights, nuclear proliferation and the theft of a Mickey Mouse trademark.

1986,"  A foundation created by Frederick W. Richmond, a former member of Congress from Brooklyn, has offered to pay $750,000 to Michael Bennett for the option to buy a lower Broadway building that is owned by Mr. Bennett and that houses several dance companies, theater crafts workshops and rehearsal studios.   Mr. Richmond's commitment of funds enabled the tenants to make a last-minute effort to stop the sale of the building, at 890 Broadway, to a real-estate development concern that reportedly plans to convert it into standard office space.   Justin Colin, chairman of the finance committee of the American Ballet Theater, which rents studio and office space in the building, said that the $750,000 would offset any financial loss to Mr. Bennett, who reportedly feels compelled to sell the building before the first of the year, while he can still take advantage of current tax laws. Mr. Colin said the tenants hoped that by purchasing the one-year option, they would have time to raise $15 million more to purchase the building. ARTS TNNANTS ENLIST FOUNDATION AID"

The little company in Ogallala blends milkweed floss -- the shiny fibers exposed when the pods crack open in the spring -- with goose down to create batting for comforters and pillows. Insulation aside, the floss's biggest selling point is that it's hypoallergenic. ""The hollow fibers of the milkweed trap and suppress the dust and dander in down,"" explains Herb Knudsen, the president of Natural Fibers.          Sales of Ogallala down comforters and pillows doubled last year, but one of  the company's biggest problems is growing enough Syriaca. (The company, no doubt concerned about the marketability of bedding made of weeds, prefers milkweed's scientific nomen.) ""In cornfields, milkweed is a problem,"" Knudsen says, ""but when you try to grow it alone, it falls prey to diseases. And you can't use most herbicides to control other weeds, because they're designed to kill milkweed."" That's why he pays his neighbors $8 a bag for combing the pods from their own fields.

With Mr. Pryce (who replaces the admirable but uneasy John Lithgow) playing the silken swindler to Norbert Leo Butz's vulgar grifter, it's as if a mismatched entry in a three-legged race had become an Olympic figure-skating pair (2:35). Imperial Theater, 249 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'THE DROWSY CHAPERONE'  (Tony Awards, best book of a musical and best original score, 2006) This small and ingratiating spoof of 1920's stage frolics, as imagined by an obsessive show queen, may not be a masterpiece. But in a dry season for musicals, ''The Drowsy Chaperone'' has theatergoers responding as if they were withering house plants, finally being watered after long neglect. Bob Martin and Sutton Foster are the standouts in the eager, energetic cast (1:40). Marquis Theater, 1535 Broadway, at 45th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    *'FAITH HEALER' In the title role of Brian Friel's great play, Ralph Fiennes paints a portrait of the artist as dreamer and destroyer that feels both as old as folklore and so fresh that it might be painted in wet blood. Also starring Cherry Jones and the superb Ian McDiarmid, this mesmerizing series of monologues has been directed with poetic starkness by Jonathan Kent (2:35). Booth Theater, 222 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    * 'THE HISTORY BOYS' (Tony Awards, best play and best direction of a play, 2006) Madly enjoyable. Alan Bennett's play about a battle for the hearts and minds of a group of university-bound students, imported with the original British cast from the National Theater, moves with a breezy narrative swagger that transcends cultural barriers. Directed by Nicholas Hytner, with a perfectly oiled ensemble led by the superb Richard Griffiths and Stephen Campbell Moore as schoolmasters with opposing views of history and education (2:40). Broadhurst Theater, 235 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'JERSEY BOYS'  (Tony Award, best musical, 2006) From grit to glamour with the Four Seasons, directed by the pop repackager Des McAnuff (''The Who's Tommy''). The real thrill of this shrink-wrapped bio-musical, for those who want something more than recycled chart toppers and a story line poured from a can, is watching the wonderful John Lloyd Young (as Frankie Valli) cross the line from exact impersonation into something far more compelling (2:30). August Wilson Theater, 245 West 52nd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    * 'THE LIEUTENANT OF INISHMORE' Please turn off your political-correctness monitor along with your cellphone for Martin McDonagh's gleeful, gory and appallingly entertaining play. This blood farce about terrorism in rural Ireland, acutely directed by Wilson Milam, has a carnage factor to rival Quentin Tarantino's. But it is also wildly, absurdly funny and, even more improbably, severely moral (1:45). Lyceum Theater, 149 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    * 'SWEENEY TODD' (Tony Award, best direction of a musical, 2006) Sweet dreams, New York. This thrilling new revival of Stephen Sondheim and Hugh Wheeler's musical, with Michael Cerveris and Patti LuPone leading a cast of 10 who double as their own musicians, burrows into your thoughts like a campfire storyteller who knows what really scares you. The inventive director John Doyle aims his pared-down interpretation at the squirming child in everyone who wants to have his worst fears both confirmed and dispelled (2:30). Eugene O'Neill Theater, 230 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'TARZAN'  This writhing green blob with music, adapted by Disney Theatrical Productions from the 1999 animated film, has the feeling of a super-deluxe day care center, equipped with lots of bungee cords and karaoke synthesizers, where children can swing when they get tired of singing, and vice versa. The soda-pop score is by Phil Collins (2:30). Richard Rodgers Theater, 226 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley)    * 'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' The happy news for this happy-making little musical is that the move to larger quarters has dissipated none of its quirky charm. William Finn's score sounds plumper and more rewarding than it did Off Broadway, providing a sprinkling of sugar to complement the sass in Rachel Sheinkin's zinger-filled book. The performances are flawless. Gold stars all around (1:45). Circle in the Square, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Charles Isherwood)    'THE WEDDING SINGER'  An assembly-kit musical that might as well be called ''That 80's Show,'' this stage version of the 1998 film is all winks and nods and quotations from the era of big hair and junk bonds. The cast members, who include Stephen Lynch and Laura Benanti, are personable enough, which is not the same as saying they have personalities (2:20). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    Off Broadway    * 'BRIDGE & TUNNEL' (Tony Award, special theatrical event, 2006) This delightful solo show, written and performed by Sarah Jones, is a sweet-spirited valentine to New York, its polyglot citizens and the larger notion of an all-inclusive America. In 90 minutes of acutely observed portraiture gently tinted with humor, Ms. Jones plays more than a dozen men and women participating in an open-mike evening of poetry for immigrants. Helen Hayes Theater, 240 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)    'CRAZY FOR THE DOG' Christopher Boal's effective family melodrama about a brother, a sister, a wife and a boyfriend caught in a web of recrimination and confession, touched off by the kidnapping of a shih tzu (2:00). Bouwerie Lane Theater, 330 Bowery, at Bond Street, East Village, (212) 677-0060, Ext. 16. (George Hunka)    'THE FIELD'  John B. Keane's portrait of rural life in Ireland in the mid-20th century, both sorrowful and censorious. This sturdy new production, directed by Ciaran O'Reilly, features Marty Maguire as Bull McCabe, a tough farmer who will stop at nothing to preserve his right to raise his cattle on a field about to be auctioned. A little moralistic, but powerful nonetheless (2:30). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-2737. (Isherwood)    * 'FORBIDDEN BROADWAY: SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT' This production features the expected caricatures of ego-driven singing stars. But even more than usual, the show offers an acute list of grievances about the sickly state of the Broadway musical, where, as the lyrics have it, ''everything old is old again'' (1:45). 47th Street Theater, 304 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'THE HOUSE IN TOWN'  A wan new drama by Richard Greenberg about an American marriage slowly imploding in the days before the country's economy did the same, more suddenly and spectacularly, in 1929. A miscast Jessica Hecht stars as Amy Hammer, a well-to-do housewife sliding into despair as her remote husband looks on in frustration. Doug Hughes's production is pretty but desultory, as is Mr. Greenberg's typically eloquent but atypically empty writing (1:30). Mitzi E. Newhouse Theater, 150 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)    'JACQUES BREL IS ALIVE AND WELL AND LIVING IN PARIS' A powerfully sung revival of the 1968 revue, presented with affectionate nostalgia by the director Gordon Greenberg. As in the original, two men (Robert Cuccioli and Drew Sarich) and two women (Natascia Diazand Gay Marshall) perform a wide selection of Brel's plaintive ballads and stirring anthems. Ms. Marshall's captivating performance of ''Ne Me Quitte Pas,'' sung in the original French and with heart-stirring transparency, represents Brel at his best (2:00).Zipper Theater, 336 West 37th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)    * '[TITLE OF SHOW]' Jeff Bowen and Hunter Bell are the authors, stars and subject matter of this delectable new musical about its own making. The self-consciousness is tempered by a wonderful cast performing with the innocence of kids cavorting in a sandbox. It's a worthy postmodern homage to classic backstage musicals, and an absolute must for show queens (1:30). Vineyard Theater, 108 East 15th Street, Flatiron district, (212) 279-4200. (Isherwood)    'PIG FARM' A gleefully stupid comedy by Greg Kotis about lust and violence in the farm belt, with a few gristly bits of satire aimed at the fat-bellied American electorate thrown in for good measure. Powered by the frenzied commitment of the four skilled actors who make up its cast, the comedy careers around the stage like an interminable improv session for a still-unformulated sketch on ''Saturday Night Live.'' (2:15). Harold and Miriam Steinberg Center for Theater, 111 West 46th Street, (212) 719-1300. (Isherwood)    * 'ROOM SERVICE' The Peccadillo Theater Company puts a charge into this old comedy from the 1930's, thanks to a brisk pace by the director, Dan Wackerman, and a dozen dandy performances. David Edwards is the would-be producer whose bills threaten to swamp his efforts to put a show on Broadway, and Fred Berman is particularly fine as his director (2:00). Bank Street Theater, 155 Bank Street, West Village, (212) 868-4444.(Neil Genzlinger)    * 'SPRING AWAKENING' German schoolboys of the 19th-century frolic like rockers in this adventurous new musical adapted from the 1891 play by Frank Wedekind about sex, death and adolescence. Staged with élan by Michael Mayer, and featuring alluringly melancholy music by the pop singer-songwriter Duncan Sheik, this is a flawed but vibrant show that stretches the stage musical in new directions (2:10). Atlantic Theater, 336 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)    'SUSAN AND GOD' The Mint Theater Company's fine revival of Rachel Crothers's 1937 comedy about religion, career and family features Leslie Hendrix of ''Law & Order,'' excellent in the role of Susan. Jonathan Bank directs (2:20). The Mint Theater, 311 West 43rd Street, third floor, Clinton, (212) 315-0231. (Hunka)    'TEMPEST TOSSED FOOLS' This musical audience-participation children's version of ''The Tempest'' is rowdy, colorful and not all that Shakespearean. Manhattan Ensemble Theater, 55 Mercer Street, SoHo, (212) 239-6200. (Anita Gates)    'TREASON' The poet Ezra Pound was a repellent fellow, judging from this play by Sallie Bingham: racist, anti-Semitic, eager to exploit the affections of the women who loved him. Just why women were drawn to him is never clear, but the play is thoughtful, and the acting, especially by Philip Pleasants as Pound, is superb (2:10). Perry Street Theater, 31 Perry Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 868-4444. (Genzlinger)    Off Off Broadway    'CHEKHOV & MARIA'  Jovanka Bach's final play is a touching, beautifully acted if sometimes slow-paced study of Anton Chekhov's near-final days and his relationship with his sister, who cared for him (2:00). Barrow Group Theater, 312 West 36th Street; (212) 868-4444. (Gates)    'FOOD FOR FISH' Adam Szymkowicz's fabulously weird and weirdly fabulous new comedy fools around with cross-dressing, suicidal writers and Chekhovian characters who long for New Jersey (2:00). Kraine Theater, 85 East Fourth Street, between Second and Third Avenues, East Village, (212) 352-3101. (Gates)    Long-Running Shows    * 'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200.(Isherwood)    'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden, 252 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST' Cartoon made flesh, sort of (2:30). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley)    'CHICAGO' Irrefutable proof that crime pays (2:25). Ambassador Theater, 219 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'DRUMSTRUCK' Lightweight entertainment that stops just short of pulverizing the eardrums (1:30).Dodger Stages, Stage 2, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Lawrence Van Gelder)    'HAIRSPRAY' Fizzy pop, cute kids, large man in a housedress (2:30). Neil Simon Theater, 250 West 52nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    'THE LION KING' Disney on safari, where the big bucks roam (2:45). Minskoff Theater, 200 West 45th Street at Broadway, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    'MAMMA MIA!' The jukebox that devoured Broadway (2:20). Cadillac Winter Garden Theater, 1634 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA' Who was that masked man, anyway? (2:30). Majestic Theater, 247 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'THE PRODUCERS' The ne plus ultra of showbiz scams (2:45). St. James Theater, 246 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'RENT' East Village angst and love songs to die for (2:45). Nederlander Theater, 208 West 41st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    'SPAMALOT' This staged re-creation of the mock-medieval movie ''Monty Python and the Holy Grail'' is basically a singing scrapbook for Python fans. Such a good time is being had by so many people that this fitful, eager celebration of inanity and irreverence has found a large and lucrative audience (2:20). Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'WICKED' Oz revisited, with political corrections (2:45). Gershwin Theater, 222 West 51st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    Last Chance    'HOT FEET' A dancing encyclopedia of clichés set to music by Earth, Wind & Fire. Numbing (2:30). Hilton Theater, 213 West 42nd Street; (212) 307-4100; closing Sunday. (Isherwood)    'MANHATTAN MADCAPS of 1924' A not-very-madcap story is indeed included, but this is essentially a revue made of up of Rodgers and Hart songs, many of them fairly obscure. Better singing voices in the cast might help show them off to fuller advantage; as it is, the main attraction is a trio of songs with unfamiliar lyrics, but a very familiar tune: the one that, on the fourth try, became ''Blue Moon'' (1:20). Symphony Space, Broadway at 95th Street, (212) 864-5400; closing Sunday. (Genzlinger)    'SCHOOL OF THE AMERICAS' José Rivera, who wrote the screenplay for ''The Motorcycle Diaries,'' penned this rickety piece of historical speculation about the final two days of Che Guevara's life (2:00). Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 239-6200; closing Sunday.(Jason Zinoman)    'SHAKESPEARE IS DEAD' Orran Farmer's two-character drama about a struggling playwright and a drug-addicted actress-stripper is well-meaning, but tedious and often trite (1:00). Paradise Factory, 64 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 868-4444; closing tomorrow. (Gates)    'TROUBLE IN PARADISE' Ernst Lubitsch's 1932 film comedy about a con man, the con woman he loves and a wealthy Parisian widow lives again as a giddy, good-looking, quietly amusing play (1:30). Hudson Guild Theater, 441 West 26th Street, Chelsea, (212) 352-3101; closing tomorrow. (Gates)    Movies    Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, show times and tickets: nytimes.com/movies.    * 'AN INCONVENIENT TRUTH' (PG, 96 minutes) Al Gore gives a lecture on climate change. One of the most exciting and necessary movies of the year. Seriously. (A. O. Scott)    * 'ARMY OF SHADOWS' (No rating, 140 minutes, in French) Dark as pitch and without compromise, Jean-Pierre Melville's 1969 masterpiece centers on the feats of a small band of Resistance fighters during the occupation. Brilliant, harrowing, essential viewing.(Manohla Dargis)    'THE BREAK-UP' (PG-13, 105 minutes) Jennifer Aniston and Vince Vaughn split up and share custody of a Chicago condominium. Dull and cheerless, notwithstanding a handful of funny supporting turns, notably from Judy Davis and Jason Bateman. (Scott)    'CARS' (G, 114 minutes) The latest 3-D toon from Pixar just putt, putt, putts along, a shining model of technological progress and consumer safety. John Lasseter directed, and Owen Wilson provides the voice of the little red race car who learns all the right lessons from, among others, a 1951 Hudson Hornet given voice by Paul Newman. (Dargis)    'CLICK' (PG-13, 98 minutes) Adam Sandler stars in this unfunny comedy about a harried family man who uses a universal remote to hop-scotch through time. It's a wonderful life, not. (Dargis)    * 'CHANGING TIMES' (No rating, 95 minutes, in French and Arabic) Gérard Depardieu and Catherine Deneuve star in André Téchiné's rich, warmhearted exploration of cultural collision in contemporary Tangier. A half-dozen skillfully interwoven subplots create a set of variations on the theme of divided sensibilities tugging one another into states of perpetual unrest and possible happiness. (Stephen Holden)    * 'LEONARD COHEN: I'M YOUR MAN' (PG-13, 104 minutes) This enthralling documentary combines pieces of an extended interview with Mr. Cohen, the Canadian singer-songwriter, poet and author, now 71, with a tribute concert at the Sydney Opera House in January 2005. Nick Cave, Rufus Wainwright, Kate and Anna McGarrigle, Martha Wainwright and Antony are among the featured performers. (Holden)    'THE DA VINCI CODE' (PG-13, 148 minutes) Theology aside, ''The Da Vinci Code'' is, above all, a murder mystery. And as such, once it gets going, Ron Howard's movie has its pleasures. He and the screenwriter Akiva Goldsman have deftly rearranged some elements of the plot, unkinking a few overelaborate twists and introducing others that keep the action moving along. The movie does, however, take a while to accelerate, popping the clutch and leaving rubber on the road as it tries to establish who is who, what he's doing and why. So I certainly can't support any calls for boycotting or protesting this busy, trivial, inoffensive film. Which is not to say that I'm recommending that you go see it. (Scott)    'THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA' (PG-13, 106 minutes) Lauren Weisberger's score-settling best seller about a terrible (and famous) boss is reimagined and reversed. Anne Hathaway plays the beleaguered assistant, but she is much less interesting -- and in the end less sympathetic -- than the boss, Miranda Priestly, incarnated by Meryl Streep as a subtle and searching (and very funny) portrait of glamour and power. (Scott)    'EDMOND' (R, 76 minutes) William H. Macy gives what may be the performance of his career in the faithful screen adaptation of David Mamet's raw, epithet-spattered spiritual fable about a buttoned-up milquetoast who heeds his inner demons and plummets into free fall; hateful and unforgettable. (Holden)    * 'EXCELLENT CADAVERS' (No rating, 92 minutes, in English and Italian) Based on the book by Alexander Stille, this tough, brisk documentary follows Mr. Stille to Italy, where he reconstructs the recent history of the Italian mafia, focusing on the careers of two courageous prosecutors who took on organized crime and the political system that protected it. (Scott)    'THE FAST AND THE FURIOUS: TOKYO DRIFT' (PG-13, 98 minutes) The ''Fast and Furious'' formula (dudes + cars + babes = $) is recycled in Tokyo, where the cars are smaller, and the clothes are kookier, but the boys are still boys. (Nathan Lee)    'GARFIELD: A TAIL OF TWO KITTIES'  (PG, 80 minutes) It was the worst of times. (Dargis)    * 'GABRIELLE' (No rating, 90 minutes) A film of eccentric beauty and wild feeling, directed by the consistently inventive Patrice Chéreau and starring the supremely well-matched Pascal Greggory and Isabelle Huppert, about the dissolution of a haute bourgeoisie Parisian marriage, circa 1912. (Dargis)    'THE GROOMSMEN' (R, 93 minutes) Just when it seems Edward Burns might have pulled off an American ''I Vitelloni,'' his X-ray vision into life in an Irish-American enclave in New York glazes over and he resolves his characters' anxiety and despair with tearful hugs and phony reassurances. (Holden)    * 'HEADING SOUTH' (No rating, 105 minutes, in English and French) Sex tourism involving middle-age white women and black beach boys at a Haitian resort in the late 1970's is the subject of Laurent Cantet's third film, one of the most truthful explorations of desire, age and youth ever filmed, with a politically charged subtext about capitalist imperialism. (Holden)    'KEEPING UP WITH THE STEINS' (PG-13, 84 minutes) A rollicking bar mitzvah comedy begins as a growling, razor-toothed satire of carnivorous consumption in Hollywood. But after the first half-hour, those growls subside into whimpers, and the fangs are retracted, and the movie morphs turns into a feel-good family comedy oozing good vibes. (Holden)    'KILL YOUR IDOLS' (No rating, 71 minutes) S. A. Crary's glib, unfocused music documentary examines the New York No Wave scene of the late 1970's -- an offshoot of punk, the anti-New Wave -- when the music was noisy (and genuinely noncommercial) and the clothes were black (and genuinely secondhand). (Dargis)    'THE LAKE HOUSE' (PG, 108 minutes) Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock, reunited 12 years after ''Speed,'' play would-be lovers separated by time and yet somehow able to communicate. The absolute preposterousness of this teary romance is inseparable from its charm, which is greater than you might expect. (Scott)    'LITTLE MAN' (PG-13, 90 minutes) A belligerent midget jewel thief assaults groins and molests women in this infantile comedy from the Wayans brothers. (Lee)    'MINI'S FIRST TIME' (R, 91 minutes) Yet another poor little rich girl tends to her festering inner wounds by becoming one of Southern California's children of the damned. Nikki Reed stars alongside the slumming likes of Alec Baldwin, Carrie-Anne Moss, Jeff Goldblum and Luke Wilson. (Dargis)    * 'LA MOUSTACHE' (No rating, 86 minutes, in French) Emmanuel Carrière's psychological mystery prepares you to bask in one of those sexy, bittersweet marital comedies that are a hallmark of sophisticated French cinema. Then, by degrees, it subverts those expectations to spiral down a rabbit hole of ambiguity and doubt. (Holden)    * 'THE OH IN OHIO' (No rating, 91 minutes) A feel-good movie about feeling good, this fresh and very funny sex comedy stars Parker Posey as a woman in search of an orgasm, Paul Rudd as her frustrated husband and a delirious supporting cast: Danny DeVito as a swimming pool salesman, Heather Graham as a sex shop clerk and Liza Minnelli as a masturbation guru who encourages frigid women to ''liberate your labia!'' (Lee)    * 'NACHO LIBRE' (PG, 91 minutes) A sweet bliss-out from the writers Mike White, Jerusha Hess and Jared Hess, who also directed, that finds a glorious Jack Black as a half-Mexican, half-Scandinavian monastery cook who aches to belong to another brotherhood, that of the luchadores, or masked wrestlers. (Dargis)    'OVER THE HEDGE' (PG, 83 minutes) This tale about some woodland critters threatened by their new human neighbors has the technical trappings of a worthwhile Saturday matinee, so it's too bad no one paid commensurate attention to the script. The writers, including Karey Kirkpatrick, who directed with Tim Johnson, pad the story with the usual yuks and some glop about family, but there is no poetry here and little thought. (Dargis)    'PEACEFUL WARRIOR' (PG-13, 120 minutes) As ludicrous as the title promises yet supremely unembarrassed, this New Age enlightenment parable has its heart in the right place, but a mind of corny mush. (Lee)    'PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN: DEAD MAN'S CHEST' Although there are memorable bits and pieces, this is a movie with no particular interest in coherence, economy or feeling. (Scott)    * 'A PRAIRIE HOME COMPANION' (PG-13, 105 minutes) Garrison Keillor's long-running Public Radio hootenanny turns out to be the perfect vehicle for Robert Altman's fluid, chaotic humanism. The performances -- especially by Lily Tomlin and Meryl Streep as a pair of singing sisters -- are so full of relaxed vitality that you almost don't notice that the film is, at heart, a wry, sober contemplation of mortality. (Scott)    'THE ROAD TO GUANTÁNAMO' (R, 91 minutes) Michael Winterbottom's powerful, slippery new film mixes documentary and fictional techniques to tell the true story of three British Muslims imprisoned by the United States government in Guantánamo Bay, Cuba. (Scott)    'RUSSIAN DOLLS' (No rating, 129 minutes, in English, Russian, French and Spanish) The sequel to the international hit ''L'Auberge Espagnole'' belongs to a long line of airy French films that induce a pleasant buzz of Euro-envy. Like its forerunner, it is a generational group portrait of young, smart, sexy, well-educated Europeans at work and play filmed in a style that might be called Truffaut Lite. (Holden)    'A SCANNER DARKLY' (R, 100 minutes) Identities shift and melt like shadows in Richard Linklater's animated adaptation of the Philip K. Dick semispeculative novel ''A Scanner Darkly,'' a look at a future that appears an awful lot like today. With the voices and gestures of Keanu Reeves, Woody Harrelson, Winona Ryder and a wonderful Robert Downey Jr. (Dargis)    '71 FRAGMENTS OF A CHRONOLOGY OF CHANCE' (No rating, 95 minutes) This 1994 film from that great provocateur Michael Haneke follows a handful of seemingly unrelated characters, all of whom -- perhaps by chance, perhaps by divine intervention, though mostly through artistic contrivance -- have the grave misfortune to be in an Austrian bank when a student starts unloading his revolver. (Dargis)    'STRANGERS WITH CANDY' (R, 87 minutes) High school high jinks, adapted from the beloved Comedy Central series. The comedy is stretched a little thin by the feature length, but there are still some laughs. (Scott)    'SUPERMAN RETURNS' (PG-13, 157 minutes) Last seen larking about on the big screen in the 1987 dud ''Superman IV,'' the Man of Steel has been resurrected in Bryan Singer's leaden new film not only to fight for truth, justice and the American way, but also to give Mel Gibson's passion a run for his box-office money. Where once the superhero flew up, up and away, he now flies down, down, down, sent from above to save mankind from its sins and another bummer summer. (Dargis)    'WAIST DEEP' (R, 97 minutes) Tyrese Gibson plays an ex-convict trying to rescue his son from ruthless criminal kidnappers in this far-from-terrible B movie, directed with style and heart by Vondie Curtis Hall. (Scott)    'WASSUP ROCKERS' (R, 105 minutes) The latest provocation from the director and photographer Larry Clark follows a group of teenage Hispanic skateboarders from South Central Los Angeles on a 24-hour adventure that takes them from one hell (the inner city) to another (decadent Beverly Hills) and back. (Holden)    * 'WHO KILLED THE ELECTRIC CAR?' (PG, 92 minutes) A murder mystery, a call to arms and an effective inducement to rage, Chris Paine's film about the recent rise and fall of the electric car is the latest and one of the more successful additions to the growing ranks of issue-oriented documentaries. ( Dargis)    'X-MEN: THE LAST STAND' (PG-13, 104 minutes) As expected, the third and presumably last film about the powerful Marvel Comics mutants who walk and often fight among us pretty much looks and plays like the first two, though perhaps with more noise and babes, and a little less glum. The credited writers here are Simon Kinberg and Zak Penn, who, like the director, Brett Ratner, are not mutant enough to fly. (Dargis)    YOU, ME AND DUPREE' (PG-13, 108 minutes) Owen Wilson stars as the dude who comes to dinner and stays way past dessert in Joe and Anthony Russo's generally unfunny comedy. A fine Matt Dillon and a decorative Kate Hudson also star, rather more wanly. (Dargis)    Film Series    GREAT VILLAINS IN CINEMA (Through July 30) BAMcinématek is honoring movie bad guys, from Dracula to Michael Corleone.

DICKEY BETTS AND GREAT SOUTHERN (Wednesday) Kicked out of the Allman Brothers, a band he founded, the guitarist Dickey Betts wasted no time in going back on tour with his own group. His chiming, symmetrical guitar solos and the weary but amiable voice from songs like ''Blue Skies'' are intact, and he may even have something to prove. With Kenny Wayne Shepherd. At 9:30 p.m., Beacon Theater, 2124 Broadway, at 74th Street, (212) 496-7070 or (212) 307-7171; $52. (Jon Pareles)    MARY J. BLIGE (Tonight) Mary J. Blige has long been emoting through hip-hop and soul for ''all my sisters, my troubled sisters.'' Her latest, ''The Breakthrough'' (Geffen), also finds her in a duet with U2. (She steals the show.) With Jaheim and LeToya. At 8, Madison Square Garden, (212) 465-6741; $59.50 to $129.50. (Ben Sisario)    * BRAND NEW (Thursday) This Long Island emo band made a quantum leap with its second album three years ago, from whiny and unchallenging breakup songs to tangles of explosive melody with brooding, sometimes horrific lyrics. What the band will come up with on the as-yet-unscheduled album No. 3 is a subject of intense speculation among fans, who quickly snatched up all tickets for this tour. At 6:30 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 533-2111; sold out. (Sisario)    JIM CAMPILONGO, JESSE HARRIS, MIKE VIOLA (Monday) Just another night at the Living Room, a plain Lower East Side cabaret that puts on one guitar-cradling singer-songwriter after another, some of them world-class. Mr. Campilongo is a well-traveled guitar whiz who plays with Norah Jones in her country band the Little Willies; here he leads his Electric Trio. Jesse Harris, who wrote Ms. Jones's hit ''Don't Know Why,'' sings in the graceful and guileless manner of Paul Simon and James Taylor when on his own. Mike Viola, jumping from piano to guitar, sings strident power-pop with some jagged wit. At 9 p.m., 154 Ludlow Street, near Stanton Street, Lower East Side, (212) 533-7235; no cover. (Sisario)    * CAT POWER (Tuesday) For her most recent album, ''The Greatest'' (Matador), Chan Marshall, the superbly rueful singer known as Cat Power, recorded with a group of veteran Memphis soul players, yielding some of the most stirring -- and happiest -- music of her career. Performing solo, she is spellbindingly intense and mercurial. At 8 p.m., Hiro Ballroom at the Maritime Hotel, 371 West 16th Street, Chelsea, (212) 242-4300; $20. (Sisario)    CHEB I SABBAH (Tomorrow) Indian devotional music meets the beat, now and then, in the music of DJ Cheb I Sabbah, who swirls together various styles into heady meditations. He is joined on vocals by the singer Riffat Salamat Sultana, daughter of the Pakistani singer Ustad Salamat Ali Khan. At 7 p.m., Central Park SummerStage, Rumsey Playfield, midpark at 70th Street, (212) 360-2777; free, but a donation is suggested. (Pareles)    BLOSSOM DEARIE (Tomorrow and Sunday) To watch this singer and pianist is to appreciate the power of a carefully deployed pop-jazz minimalism combined with a highly discriminating taste in songs. The songs date from all periods of a career remarkable for its longevity and for Ms. Dearie's stubborn independence and sly wit. Tomorrow at 7 p.m., Sunday at 6:15 p.m., Danny's Skylight Room, 346 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 265-8133; $25, with a $15 minimum, or $54.50 for a dinner-and-show package.(Stephen Holden)    DON CABALLERO (Tonight) In the mid-1990's, Don Caballero, from Pittsburgh, was one of a handful of overachieving guitar bands whose knotty, laser-precise and deliberately undanceable instrumentals exemplified the fittingly named subgenre math-rock. The band broke up six years ago, but its drummer, Damon Che, has repopulated it with new players; its new album, ''World Class Listening Problem'' (Relapse), suggests that there was more to the old group's appeal than just math. With Blind Idiot God, Alger Hiss, Houston McCoy and the Victoria Lucas. At 8, Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3006; $13. (Sisario)    'DOT DASH YEAR IV' (Thursday) Each summer Dot Dash, a little concert promoter in Brooklyn devoted to punk and garage-rock, throws a festival with some big-deal reunions -- big deals in the small and passionate world of garage-rock, anyway. This year its three-day series begins on Thursday with the return of the Dicks, a Texas band from the early 1980's that sang ragged and churlish complaints with titles like ''Hate the Police.'' Also on the bill are the Marked Men, the Carbonas and Live Fast Die. The highlight of the festival will be an appearance by Rocket From the Tombs on July 29. At 8 p.m., Southpaw, 125 Fifth Avenue, near Sterling Place, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 230-0236; $17. (Sisario)    EARLY MAN, BAD WIZARD, 3 INCHES OF BLOOD (Tuesday) The best retro bands do not just conjure up an old artist or even a specific era, but freely toy with their influences to suggest a past that never quite existed. Three Inches of Blood updates the galloping, swords-and-goblins rock of early-1980's groups like Iron Maiden and Manowar with harsh streaks of violence that recall later death-metal. Early Man, on its debut album, ''Closing In'' (Matador), begins in the comforting mud of Black Sabbath and ends airborne, with a speed and control that comes down from Metallica. Also on the bill is Bad Wizard, whose plodding re-creations of Grand Funk Railroad and Kiss illustrate a less imaginative kind of retro-rock. At 8 p.m., Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3132; $12 in advance, $14 at the door. (Sisario)    MELISSA ETHERIDGE (Monday through Wednesday) Love takes on heroic dimensions in the songs of Melissa Etheridge. She puts her own mark on the brawny guitar riffs and raspy-voiced melodies of 1980's heartland rock, as adoring audiences sing along. At 8 p.m., Theater at Madison Square Garden, (212) 465-6741; $39.50 to $104.50. (Pareles)    GOLDEN SMOG (Wednesday) Even heartsick alt-country has its celebrity supergroups. Golden Smog includes Jeff Tweedy of Wilco, Dan Murphy of Soul Asylum, Gary Louris and Marc Perlman of the Jayhawks, and Kraig Johnson of Run Westy Run. Opening the show is David Poe, a singer and guitarist, whose wit and sparkle come through largely between songs. At 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111; sold out. (Sisario)    HOLD STEADY (Thursday) Like the E Street Band fronted by Shane MacGowan of the Pogues, the Hold Steady -- from Brooklyn, though with Minneapolis origins -- plays bare-knuckled guitar-rock while its singer, Craig Finn, free-associates about religion and sex in a boozy snarl. ''I guess I heard about original sin,'' he growls. ''I heard the dude blamed the chick.'' At 7 p.m., Castle Clinton National Monument, Battery Park, Lower Manhattan, (212) 835-2789. Free; tickets available at 5 p.m., two per person. (Sisario)    JONATHAN KANE (Tomorrow) John Lee Hooker meets La Monte Young in the droning, bluesy incantations of Mr. Kane, a mainstay in the downtown avant-garde scene who has played drums with Swans, Rhys Chatham and Gary Lucas. He has a drummer's sense of steady dynamic development and an unapologetic love of noise. He plays two shows. At 2 p.m., with Dragons of Zynth, Home and Taiko Masala, East River Amphitheater, East River Park, south of Delancey Street, Lower East Side, ermp.org; free. At 9 p.m., with Golden Tongues, Mahi Mahi and Ambitious Orchestra, Sin-é, 150 Attorney Street, Lower East Side, (212) 388-0077; $10. (Sisario)    * JASON LYTLE (Tomorrow and Monday) In Grandaddy, Mr. Lytle sang as if he were Neil Young trapped inside a computer chip: with a voice tiny and yet infinite, yearning to be fully human yet stuck within the strictures of the information age. Grandaddy recently released its final album, ''Just Like the Fambly Cat'' (V2), but it is an unsatisfying epitaph; fans will crowd these rare solo shows for hints of a new direction. Tomorrow at 7 p.m., Monday at 9:30 p.m., Joe's Pub, Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 239-6200; $20. (Sisario)    MALDITA VECINDAD, KONONO NO. 1, DAARA J (Sunday) What do a ska-flavored Mexican hard-rock band, a Congolese group that makes trance music from amplified thumb pianos and a Senegalese rap trio have in common? Not much except that they can all be lumped into the world-music category, however puzzlingly. Maldita Vecindad paints its ska rhythms with ominous, distorted metal. Konono No. 1 titled one album ''Congotronics,'' an apt term for its polyrhythmic bubblings of amplified likembés -- hand-held thumb pianos made from thin strips of medal. Daara J speed-raps in at least four languages: English, French, Spanish and Wolof. At 3 p.m., Central Park SummerStage, Rumsey Playfield, midpark at 70th Street, (212) 360-2777; free, but a donation is suggested. Maldita Vecindad also plays Sunday night at S.O.B.'s, and Konono No. 1 plays there on Monday.

(Sisario)    THOMAS MAPFUMO AND THE BLACKS UNLIMITED (Tuesday) A musical pioneer with a rebel's courage, Thomas Mapfumo made music for the revolutionaries who unseated the white-ruled government from what was Rhodesia and is now Zimbabwe. The music transferred the brisk patterns of traditional thumb-piano music to guitar; the words sometimes sent coded messages. At 8 and 10:30 p.m., S.O.B.'s, 204 Varick Street, at Houston Street, South Village, (212) 243-4940; $20 in advance, $22 at the door. (Pareles)    JOHN MAYALL AND THE BLUESBREAKERS (Tonight) In the 1960's John Mayall ran the premier finishing school for British blues-rock guitarists: at various times his band -- still called the Bluesbreakers despite 40-odd years of lineup changes -- included the young Eric Clapton, Mick Taylor (later of the Rolling Stones) and Peter Green (later of Fleetwood Mac), among others. At 8 and 10:30, B. B. King Blues Club and Grill, 243 West 42nd Street, (212) 997-4144; $30. (Sisario)    OAKLEY HALL (Tonight) Patient country-folk mutates into dense psychedelic drones in the songs of this Brooklyn band led by Pat Sullivan, a former member of Brooklyn's other masters of psychedelic minimalism, Oneida. With Mike Wexler, Black Taj and Endless Boogie. At 8:30, Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700; $10. (Sisario)    * OS MUTANTES (Tonight) The oddest, most exuberant and most wonderfully innovative band of the late-1960's tropicália movement in Brazil -- when there was no shortage of odd, exuberant and wonderfully innovative musicians -- was Os Mutantes (the Mutants), which filtered American and British psychedelic and garage-rock through bossa nova and a do-what-thou-wilt pop-art philosophy. The band broke up in 1978, and before this brief tour -- with some but not all of its original members -- had never performed in the United States. With Death Vessel. At 6:30, Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 533-2111; $50. (Sisario)    PRETTY GIRLS MAKE GRAVES, JASON LYTLE (Sunday) In the weeks before the concert giant Live Nation begins to put on big-ticket concerts at the McCarren Park Pool in Greenpoint, Brooklyn (its first there is Bloc Party on July 29), a number of smaller, scrappier promoters have been using the space -- a 50,000-square-foot public pool closed since 1984 -- for free shows. Sunday afternoon features Pretty Girls Make Graves, a Seattle band with a knack for angular, heartfelt melodies that cut through clouds of noise; and Mr. Lytle, the lead singer of Grandaddy, who is in town this weekend for a few appearances (see above). With Bon Savants. At 3 p.m., Lorimer Street, between Driggs Avenue and Bayard Street, thepoolparties.com. (Sisario)    RASPUTINA (Tonight) Rasputina is a charmingly improbable project: part Marie Antoinette, part metal. Three women who are cellists in corsets (as well as a drummer) sing about Transylvanian concubines as their music seesaws between elaborate chamber-music counterpoint and grunting hard-rock chords, complete with distortion. At 9, Warsaw, 261 Driggs Avenue, at Eckford Street, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, (718) 387-0505; $20. (Pareles)    BUTCH WALKER AND THE LET'S GO OUT TONITES (Wednesday) Mr. Walker first revealed his fondness for muscular mid-1970's pop-rock and his mocking obsession with stardom as the leader of the Marvelous 3. Now on his own, he hasn't lost his ambition or his sense of irony. With Boys Like Girls and As Fast As. At 8 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800; sold out.

STEVEN BERNSTEIN'S MILLENNIAL TERRITORY ORCHESTRA (Tonight and Monday) This little big band, led by the irrepressible slide trumpeter Steven Bernstein, has a forthcoming album called ''MTO Volume 1'' (Sunnyside) that is full of signature touches, like effervescent swing arrangements and covers of hits by Prince and Stevie Wonder.

(Chinen)    DON BYRON QUARTET (Wednesday through July 30) Mr. Byron is justifiably known for his independent-minded concept albums -- his next one will shine a spotlight on the rhythm-and-blues saxophonist Junior Walker -- but he is, first and foremost, a daring clarinetist. He plays here with several longtime associates: the trumpeter Ralph Alessi, the bassist Lonnie Plaxico and the drummer Billy Hart. 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232; cover, $25, $30 on July 28 and 29.

(Chinen)    * CELEBRATION OF RAY BARRETTO & HILTON RUIZ (Tuesday through July 30) ''Standards Rican-ditioned,'' recently issued on Zoho Music, was the final studio album of the conga virtuoso Ray Barretto. It also turned out to be the last recorded effort by the pianist Hilton Ruiz. Both were New York-born musicians of Puerto Rican heritage and were pillars of Latin jazz. This tribute, fittingly programmed as the culmination of Dizzy's Club Coca-Cola's monthlong Latin in Manhattan Festival, includes Mr. Barretto's son Chris Barretto, as well as a two more-established saxophonists, Sonny Fortune and David Sánchez.

(Chinen)    ORRIN EVANS QUINTET (Tomorrow) Mr. Evans is a percussive pianist equally attuned to hard bop and hip-hop, and he often surrounds himself with rhythmically assertive sidemen.

This weekend the foundation presents a fully staged production of Mozart's ''Don Giovanni,'' directed by Laura Alley and conducted by Steven Crawford, and ''An Evening of Opera Acts,'' with excerpts from ''Don Pasquale,'' ''Madama Butterfly'' and ''Falstaff,'' conducted by Willie Anthony Waters, the general and artistic director of the Connecticut Opera Association.

(Anthony Tommasini)     * GLIMMERGLASS OPERA (Tonight through Monday, and Thursday) The drive from New York City to the Glimmerglass Opera in Cooperstown, N.Y., typically takes four hours, no matter what route you choose. But it is worth the trip. The company's intimate, airy and well-equipped house is an ideal place to hear opera. And the imaginative productions, which often wind up at New York City Opera, are best seen in their tryouts at Cooperstown. Tomorrow brings the major event of the season: the premiere of Stephen Hartke's opera ''The Greater Good, or the Passion of Boule de Suif.'' Also playing this week are Gilbert and Sullivan's ''Pirates of Penzance'' in a production by Lillian Groag and Rossini's ''Barbiere di Siviglia'' in a production by Leon Major.

(Tommasini)     * 'HANSEL AND GRETEL' (Monday and Thursday) Humperdinck's orchestration for his opera ''Hansel and Gretel'' is rich and Wagnerian. But in some performances it can overwhelm this lyrical fairy tale. Kathleen Kelly, the music director of the Berkshire Opera, has prepared a chamber orchestra arrangement for that company's new fully staged production of the opera, to be performed in a new English translation by Cori Ellison at the intimate and magnificently restored theater of the Mahaiwe Performing Arts Center in Great Barrington, Mass. Ms. Kelly, an assistant conductor and coach at the Met, conducts. At 8 p.m., (413) 442-0099; $35 to $85. (Tommasini)     NEW JERSEY OPERA THEATER (Tonight through Sunday) Founded in 2002, the New Jersey Opera Theater is striving to become the state's preeminent opera company. Besides presenting performances, the company also offers master classes and educational outreach programs. The final weekend of its summer season features Mozart's ''Così Fan Tutte'' in a production by Albert Sherman, conducted by Steven Mosteller; and an intriguing double bill of Puccini's comedy ''Gianni Schicchi'' and ''Buoso's Ghost,'' a one-act work from 1996 by the composer Michael Ching. ''Buoso's Ghost'' picks up the story of the clever Schicchi where Puccini's opera leaves off. Steven Condy sings Schicchi in both works; James Caraher conducts. ''Schicchi'' and ''Buoso,'' tonight at 8 and Sunday afternoon at 2; ''Così,'' tomorrow night at 8; Berlind Theater at the McCarter Theater Center, 91 University Place, Princeton University, Princeton, N.J., (609) 258-2787; $42 and $49.

(Dunning)    DECADANCETHEATER (Thursday) This all-female hip-hop group from Brooklyn won plaudits for its reworking of Stravinsky's ''Firebird'' two years ago.

Thursday benefit tickets begin at $50.(Roslyn Sulcas)    HEIDI DUCKLER COLLAGE DANCE THEATER (Tonight through Sunday) Ms. Duckler is known as Los Angeles's ''queen of site-specific performance,'' the press release says. This production of ''Laundromatinee,'' part of the Lower Manhattan Cultural Council's Sitelines performances, may well show she deserves claim to the title. It involves dancers spinning in dryers and hanging from clotheslines, then -- this sounds like the best bit -- removing their clothes to sing ''Stand By Your Man.'' 8.30 p.m., Laundromat, 168 Elizabeth Street, between Spring and Kenmare Streets; (212) 219-9401, www.lmcc.net/sitelines; free.

Saturday at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sunday at 2 and 5 p.m., Thursday at 8 p.m., Theater 80, 80 St. Mark's Place, East Village, (212) 352-3101 or theatermania.com; $45.(Rockwell)    * PILOBOLUS (Tonight and tomorrow, Monday through Thursday) The grandfather of the current crop of Nikolais-inspired, Cirque du Soleil-like acrobatic dance troupes with spectacular visual effects.

(Sulcas)    * 'TAP CITY 2006' (Tonight and tomorrow) This spirited summer festival suggests that camaraderie and a sense of community are not dead in tap dance, on stage and in the audience. It includes two programs. ''Tap and Song,'' a celebration of traditional vaudeville, comedy and classic song-and-dance, stars the irrepressible Tony Waag, the festival's founder and director. He will be joined by a generous roster of artists, including the veteran tapper Mable Lee, the German Tap and Tray duo, the chic two-woman Tapage and the hoedown tapper Nate Cooper. ''Tap Forward'' features familiar tap soloists, cutting-edge types and up-and-comers. ''Tap and Song'' is tonight at 7 and 9:30 p.m.; ''Tap Forward'' is tomorrow at 7 and 9:30 p.m., the Duke on 42nd Street, 229 West 42nd Street; (212) 239-6200 or www.atdf.org; $40.

(Dunning)    YOUNG DANCEMAKERS COMPANY (Thursday) These choreographers -- New York City high school students chosen by audition for a summer intensive in dance technique, performing and making dances -- know how to put on a very good show. It's free, too. Their tour of city sites continues through Aug. 3. Thursday at 2 p.m. Stern Auditorium, Mount Sinai Hospital, Fifth Avenue at 100th Street, Upper East Side; (718) 329-7250 or www.ecfs.org/ydc.asp; reservations required. (Dunning)    Art    Museums and galleries are in Manhattan unless otherwise noted. Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.com/art.         Museums    Brooklyn Museum: 'Graffiti,' through Sept. 3. Twenty paintings on canvas from the early 1980's by formerly famous subway graffiti artists who went by names like Crash, Daze and Lady Pink. Brooklyn Museum, 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000. (Ken Johnson)    COOPER-HEWITT NATIONAL DESIGN MUSEUM: 'FREDERIC CHURCH, WINSLOW HOMER AND THOMAS MORAN: TOURISM AND THE AMERICAN LANDSCAPE,'  through Oct. 22. It turns out that the Cooper-Hewitt owns thousands of rarely seen paintings, prints and sketches by Church, Homer and Moran. Studies of the countryside, mostly, they revere unspoiled nature and record tourism, a booming industry in 19th-century America. Here they're combined with antique postcards, old Baedeker's guides, stereoscopic photographs, playing cards with pictures of Yellowstone on them, all to trace the nation's transformation from primeval wilderness to Catskills resort. The show is extremely entertaining. 2 East 91st Street, (212) 849-8400. (Michael Kimmelman)    DAHESH MUSEUM OF ART: 'NAPOLEON ON THE NILE: SOLDIERS, ARTISTS AND THE REDISCOVERY OF EGYPT,' through Sept. 3. Napoleon's invasion of Egypt was a military disaster, but the squadron of scholars and scientists that went with him lay the foundation for Egyptology and Egyptomania, gave Orientalism a big boost and was commemorated by the 1,000 engravings of the 23-volume ''Description de l'Égypte.'' Examples of the book's prints form the backbone of this strange and sometimes piecemeal show, which includes Orientalist paintings and a cache of fascinating ephemera. 580 Madison Avenue, at 56th Street, (212) 759-0606. (Roberta Smith)    * FRICK COLLECTION : 'JEAN-ÉTIENNE LIOTARD (1702-1789): SWISS MASTER,' through Sept. 17. Liotard is something of a specialty item now, but he was widely known in the Enlightenment Europe of his day. And even then he was seen as a maverick, a figure of contradictions. He was a stone-cold realist in an age of rococo frills. In a great age of oil painting, he favored pastel. He had ultrafancy sitters for his portraits, including the young Marie Antoinette. But his most vivid likenesses are of himself and his family. The Frick's perfectly proportioned sweetheart of a solo show is the artist's first in North America. 1 East 70th Street, (212) 288-0700. (Holland Cotter)    SOLOMON R. GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'ZAHA HADID: THIRTY YEARS IN ARCHITECTURE,' through Oct. 25. This exhibition, Ms. Hadid's first major retrospective in the United States, gives New Yorkers a chance to see what they've been missing. The show, in the Guggenheim's rotunda, spirals through Ms. Hadid's career, from her early enchantment with Soviet Constructivism to the sensuous and fluid cityscapes of her more recent commissions. It illuminates her capacity for bridging different worlds: traditional perspective drawing and slick computer-generated imagery; the era of utopian manifestos and the ambiguous values of the information age. (212) 423-3500. (Nicolai Ouroussoff)    * INTERNATIONAL CENTER OF PHOTOGRAPHY: 'UNKNOWN WEEGEE,' through Aug. 27. From the 1930's through the 50's, Weegee -- real name, Arthur Fellig (1899-1968) -- was one of the best known news photographers in the country. He specialized in capturing the sensational side of urban life: crime, disaster, demimonde nightlife. Tirelessly invasive, he lived by night. For him, the city was a 24-hour emergency room, an amphetamine drip. This show of 95 pictures gives a good sense of his range and calls particular attention to his awareness of social problems related to class and race. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000. (Cotter)    * METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'RAPHAEL AT THE METROPOLITAN: THE COLONNA ALTARPIECE,' through Sept. 3 This exhilarating show reunites the central panel and lunette of Raphael's Colonna Altarpiece (owned by the Met) with all five panels of the predella. Additional works by Raphael, Perugino, Fra Bartolommeo and Leonardo place the work in context and sharpen the understanding of Raphael's budding genius. (212) 535-7710. (Smith)    * MET: 'TREASURES OF SACRED MAYA KINGS,' through Sept. 10. ''Treasures of Sacred Maya Kings'' gets a huge gold A for truth in advertising. The treasures are plentiful, rare and splendid. A carved wood figure of kneeling shaman, arms extended, time-raked face entranced, is simply one of the greatest sculptures in the museum. And wait till you see the painted ceramic vessel known as the ''Dazzler Vase,'' with its red and green patterns like jade on fire, you'll understand its name. Much of the work has never traveled before; many objects have only recently come to light in Mexico, Guatemala and Honduras. They add up to an exhibition as a think-piece essay on how a culture saw itself in the world. (212) 535-7710. (Cotter)    * MORGAN LIBRARY AND MUSEUM: 'MASTERWORKS FROM THE MORGAN,'  through Sept. 10. Almost three years after closing to build an expansion, the Morgan is back and brilliant. What's new: Renzo Piano's four-story glass-and-steel court, a sort of giant solarium with see-through elevators; two good-size second-floor galleries; and a neat little strongbox of an enclosure, called the Cube, for reliquaries and altar vessels. What's not new: almost everything in this exhibition, which fills every gallery with mini-exhibitions of master drawings and musical manuscripts, as well as illuminated gospels and historical and literary autograph manuscripts from the Brontës to Bob Dylan. 225 Madison Avenue, at East 36th Street, (212) 685-0008 or www.themorgan.org. (Cotter)    MUSEUM OF BIBLICAL ART: 'THE WORD ON THE STREET: THE PHOTOGRAPHS OF LARRY RACIOPPO,' through Aug. 20. Photographs documenting vernacular expressions of religious devotion in New York, including spray-painted murals, private shrines and tattoos. Museum of Biblical Art, 1865 Broadway, at 61st Street, (212) 408-1500. (Johnson)    * MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'ARTIST'S CHOICE: HERZOG & DE MEURON, PERCEPTION RESTRAINED,' through Sept. 25. In an unusually accessible bit of institutional critique, the architects who failed to win the commission to design the new Museum of Modern Art bite the hand that didn't feed them. They create a kind of deprivation chamber with a black gallery, where excerpts from American movies play on video screens on the ceiling and 110 works of art and design are crammed into enormous niches that are all but sealed from view. Perverse and cerebral, it may be the best one-liner you'll encounter this summer. (212) 708-9400. (Smith)    NEW YORK BOTANICAL GARDEN : CHIHULY AT THE NEW YORK BOTANICAL GARDENS, through Oct. 29. Dale Chihuly, the world's most famous contemporary glass artist, has created ambitious installations of his large-scale, technically virtuosic and materially extravagant works inside the spectacular Haupt Conservatory and outside in formal reflecting pools and smaller gardens. New York Botanical Garden, Bronx River Parkway and Fordham Road, the Bronx, (718) 817-8700. (Johnson)    * NEW-YORK HISTORICAL SOCIETY: LEGACIES: CONTEMPORARY ARTISTS REFLECT ON SLAVERY, through Jan. 7. Slavery, some would say, didn't really end in the United States until the civil rights legislation of the 1960's. That was a full century after the Emancipation Proclamation. Or the ''Emancipation Approximation,'' as the artist Kara Walker calls it in a series of hallucinatory silkscreen prints. They are among the high points of this large, powerful, subtle group show, the second of three exhibitions on American slavery organized by the New-York Historical Society. 170 Central Park West, (212) 873-3400. (Cotter)    P.S. 1 CONTEMPORARY ART CENTER: 'INTO ME/OUT OF ME,' through Sept. 25. Often with repulsive immediacy and occasionally with wit and subtlety, works by more than 130 artists in this ambitious exhibition explore the body and all its possible experiences along the pleasure-pain continuum. P.S. 1 Contemporary Art Center, 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Avenue, Long Island City, (718) 784-2084. (Johnson)    * THE WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART : 'FULL HOUSE: VIEWS OF THE WHITNEY'S COLLECTION AT 75,' through Sept. 3. The Whitney celebrates a significant birthday this summer with an attic-to-basement display of hundreds of pieces of art from its permanent collection. There are terrific things, arranged mostly by loose theme rather than date. And as an ensemble, they deliver an impressionistic story, through art, of a staggeringly contradictory American 20th-century culture, diverse and narrow-souled, with a devotion to the idea of power so ingrained as to make conflict inevitable and chronic. If ''Full House'' is about one thing, it is about discord, about how harmonious America never was. 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3676. (Cotter)    Galleries: Uptown    * WANGECHI MUTU: EXHUMING GLUTTONY: A LOVER'S REQUIEM In tandem with this artist's Chelsea debut, an over-the-top installation made with the British architect David Adjaye includes fur-trimmed wine bottles dripping wine, animal skins and an enormous raw wood table. Conflating morgue, tannery and banquet hall, it brings the excess and color of paintings on Mylar into real space, but its main message seems to be: I built this because I can. Salon 94, 12 East 94th Street, (646) 672-9212, through July 28. (Smith)    * SARAH SZE: 'CORNER PLOT' The upper corner of an apartment building protrudes from the Doris C. Freedman Plaza's pavement as if the whole edifice had toppled and sunk into the ground. Through the window's of Ms. Sze's magical outdoor sculpture you can see a complicated interior that looks as if it were created by a mad architect. Doris C. Freedman Plaza, 60th Street and Fifth Avenue, (212) 980-4575, through Oct. 22. (Johnson)    Galleries: 57th Street    * HANS BELLMER: ' PETITES ANATOMIES, PETITES IMAGES.'  This extraordinary show of more than 70 images takes you beyond the surface obsessions of Bellmer's girl-crazed art to unveil some of his working processes as a sculptor, installation artist, photographer, editor and hand-colorist whose preference for small scale intensifies the voyeuristic nature of his art. Ubu Gallery, 416 East 59th Street, (212) 753-4444, through July 28. (Smith)    * RUDY BURCKHARDT: 'NEW YORK PAINTINGS' Known as a photographer and filmmaker, Burckhardt (1914-1999) also painted all through his career. His Manhattan cityscapes, mostly rooftop views of other buildings, have a fresh, almost naïve immediacy and a sophisticated way with relations between surface and depth and complexity and simplicity. Tibor de Nagy, 724 Fifth Avenue, (212) 262-5050, through July 28. (Johnson)    GEORGE HERMS Starting out as a beatnik in the 1950's, Mr. Herms has been creating and exhibiting his richly poetic assemblages of grungy found materials in California, his home state, for more than a half century. This show's eight works, from 1965 to 2002, variously call to mind Ernst, Duchamp, Cornell and Rauschenberg, but they have as well their own spiritually generous, heartfelt mix of hermetic imagination and Whitman-esque populism. Franklin Parrasch, 20 West 57th Street, (212) 246-5360, through July 28. (Johnson)    Galleries: SoHo    * 'A FOUR-DIMENSIONAL BEING WRITES POETRY ON A FIELD WITH SCULPTURES' Organized by the sculptor Charles Ray, this beautiful, spare and mysterious exhibition presents sculptures by Alberto Giacometti, Mark di Suvero and the folk artist Edgar Tolson, and a giant photograph by Jeff Wall. Matthew Marks, 522 West Second Street, (212) 243-0200, through Aug. 11. (Johnson)    Galleries: Chelsea    JOE BIEL With an exacting illustrator's touch, Mr. Biel draws large, dreamily perverse images of children, like the one of a girl with rabbit ears and a whip peeking out of a cardboard box and the knife-wielding boy crouching atop a pile of rubble and examining a bone he found. Goff + Rosenthal, 537B West 23rd Street, (212) 675-0461, through Aug. 12. (Johnson)    * CRG PRESENTS: KLAUS VON NICHTSSAGEND GALLERY Including works by Liz Luisada, Samuel Lopes and Thomas Ovilsen, this group show of work by 17 emerging artists definitely has its moments, but the strongest impression is made by the gallery-within-a-gallery effect resulting from the re-creation of the storefront facade and reception desk of the small Von Nichtssagend Gallery in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. CRG Gallery, 535 East 22nd Street, (212) 229-2766, through July 28. (Smith)    'Material Abuse' Unconventional uses of nontraditional materials include Shinique Smith's massive bale of all-white clothing; Michael Arcega's fleet of 300 tiny, balsa-wood tanks; Richard Klein's assemblage made from 10 years' worth of blown-out light-bulb filaments; Jean Shin's stacks of prescription pill bottles; Ray Beldner's dust-covered assemblages made of ordinary objects stolen from other people; and a star-and-stripe-patterned bikini made of map tacks by Devorah Sperber. Caren Golden, 539 West 23rd Street, (212) 727-8304, through Aug. 4. (Johnson)    'Money Changes Everything' A show of artworks made at least partly out of actual money: dollar bills, mostly, but Iraqi dinar notes, too. Schroeder Romero, 637 West 27th Street, (212) 630-0722, through July 28. (Johnson)    'Photography Is Not An Art!' More than 100 examples of vernacular, often anonymous photographs from fields of medicine, forensics, space exploration and advertising prove that nonart photography is often as interesting as the fine-art variety. Alan Klotz, 511 West 25th Street, (212) 741-4764, through Aug. 19. (Johnson)    * Vivan Sundaram: 'Re-Take of Amrita' The photographs in this beautiful, time-haunted show are all of past generations of the Indian artist Vivan Sundaram's family, and include images of his aunt, the modernist painter Amrita Sher-Gil (1913-1941). Thanks to digital technology, those generations mix in logically impossible combinations. The resulting pictures embody the past the way it survives in the mind: edited, layered, compressed, as if in a dream. Sepia International, 148 West 24th Street, 11th floor, (212) 645-9444, through July 28. (Cotter)    Last Chance    * THE NAME OF THIS SHOW IS NOT GAY ART NOW Characterized by its organizer, the artist Jack Pierson, as an ode to the passing of ''the notion of Gay Art,'' this exhibition embraces the work of about 60 artists (gay, straight and otherwise) to create a cacophonous celebration and suggest that everyone is a little bit gay, if they are lucky. Paul Kasmin Gallery, 293 10th Avenue, at 27th Street, (212) 563-4474, closes today. (Smith) THE LISTINGS -- JULY 21-JULY 27"

1986,"  IT was predictable that, in a show about Dmitri Shostakovich and Josef Stalin, the autocrat would upstage the composer. This is most definitely the case in ''Black Sea Follies,'' the new Stanley Silverman-Paul Schmidt music-theater piece that opened last night at Playwrights Horizons. ''Black Sea Follies'' proves that, given a degree of cleverness, it is easy to ridicule a dictator, but, no matter how serious or comic the intention, it is difficult, if not impossible, to portray genius.   Mr. Silverman, who conceived and directed the production for the Music-Theater Group, has tried to create a vaudeville-cum-concert that would entertain at the same time it would illuminate the Stalinist war between politics and art. When Stalin is usurping the spotlight, cutting up in the clownish performance of Alan Scarfe, the evening has an exuberance, although certainly not the drollness of ''The Great Dictator.''

1992,"  For an actor who cut his teeth on stage as an ensemble member of the Royal Shakespeare Company, Ralph Fiennes (pronounced Rafe Fines) is making a heady bid to become a leading man on screen. On Wednesday, he treads bravely into Peter O'Toole territory, playing T. E. Lawrence in ""A Dangerous Man: Lawrence After Arabia,"" a ""Great Performances"" presentation at 9 P.M. on PBS. This fall he follows in Laurence Olivier's charismatically moody wake as Heathcliff in Paramount's film remake of ""Wuthering Heights"" -- known as ""Emily Bronte's Wuthering Heights"" to avoid confusion with the 1939 version.   O'Toole and Olivier are daunting precedents by anyone's standards, especially when the sum total of your screen experience is a bit part in the British TV series ""Prime Suspect."" But Mr. Fiennes, who is 29, thinks his two new projects are distinct enough from their predecessors to minimize inevitable comparisons. ""A Dangerous Man,"" for instance, is concerned less with deserts than diplomacy; in it, Colonel Lawrence and the Arab prince Feisal come together at the 1919 Paris Peace Conference to determine the shape of the Middle East in the aftermath of World War I. UP AND COMING: Ralph Fiennes; In the Footsteps Of Olivier And O'Toole"
1993,"  Whistler and Sargent painted women carrying Chinese parasols in the 1880's, when there was a craze for chinoiserie. The Edwardians abandoned Chinese parasols for elaborate silk-and-lace Parisian versions. By the 1920's, lightweight Chinese paper-and-bamboo parasols had reappeared as the height of fashion at the races, at garden parties and summer resorts. By the end of the decade, parasols were smaller and made of printed cloth to match dresses.   Parasols were discarded before World War II, when suntanning became fashionable. Today's Chinese paper parasol is both a fashion statement and protection from the sun. This parasol is heavier than the original; the paper is now coated with a slightly odorous substance that makes it resistant to rain. A Passel Of Parasols"

1991,"  Jesus Jones adds the latest trappings to the basic three-minute pop song. On Friday night at the Academy, where their music was bolstered by canned instruments and backup vocals, band members jumped around as if the stage was red-hot; Mike Edwards, the band's singer and songwriter, kept teasing the crowd into screaming louder, while Iain Baker spent as much time pushing his keyboard around as he did playing it.    With skillful music and marketing, Jesus Jones has found a place somewhere between hip, obscure collegiate rock and MTV-ready pop-rock.  In the music, hip-hop drumbeats, fat-bottomed bass lines, noisy, echoey guitars and earnest but deniable vocals are new options for pop-song structures that go back at least to the 1960's British Invasion. Mr. Edwards's melodies often leap upward, making his voice sound both hopeful and slightly vulnerable. The most earnest of Jesus Jones's songs, ""Right Here, Right Now,"" about ""watching the world wake up from history"" in 1990, recently became a No. 1 single.

1991,"  With a gracious bow to Thornton Wilder's ""Our Town,"" Darrah Cloud's adaptation of ""O Pioneers!,"" Willa Cather's 1913 autobiographical novel, uses a bare stage and a few props to conjure up the life of a family and community over several decades. The place in this instance is rural Nebraska, and the story begins with the arrival of Swedish settlers in the 1870's. In their midst is a remarkable woman named Alexandra. She holds the story and this play together, giving ""American Playhouse"" -- at 9 on Channel 13 this evening -- claim to still another fine presentation this season.   The production, filmed on stage early last year, was staged by the director Kevin Kuhlke for the Huntington Theater Company of Boston. The veteran Channel 13 director Kirk Browning has overseen the television version, characteristically keeping the camera work fluid and unobtrusive. For the crucial role of Alexandra, the company is fortunate enough to have Mary McDonnell, nominated for an Academy Award this year for ""Dances With Wolves.""

1982,"  One of the profound artistic calamities of the 20th century was the early death, from leukemia, of the Rumanian pianist Dinu Lipatti.  Only 33 when he died in 1950, he was recognized as a prodigious talent while still a child, and began his recording career at the age of 19. In his few remaining years, Mr. Lipatti made only a scant handful of recordings, yet these have guaranteed his posthumous reputation, as they are on a uniformly high level.   Now Angel has distilled a four-record set (ZD 3924) from a more comprehensive seven-disk EMI/ Electrola reissue (IC-197-53780/86M; available from the German News Company) and has made it available on the American market. It is a fine package, and contains sterling performances of works by Bach, Mozart, Scarlatti, Chopin, Liszt, Ravel and Georges Enesco - the pianist's godfather.   Mr. Lipatti's pianism combined a rare delicacy and grace with a rock-hard structural muscle, passion with a certain Olympian detachment. His repertory was limited - he was best known as a performer of Bach, Mozart and Chopin - but this was attributable to his uncompromisingly self-critical nature rather than any pianistic shortcomings. Until late in his life, Mr. Lipatti had never publicly performed the music of Beethoven: he claimed that he did not yet feel equal to the challenge. But what he chose to play, he played splendidly; although he was not a bravura pianist, and he shunned gratuitous showmanship, his technique was impeccable.

Unless the problems are resolved early next week, Senate aides said today, there is little chance the $200 million in aid can receive final approval despite support from the Reagan Administration.   Timing is important, because the $200 million must be not only approved but also delivered to the Philippines by Oct. 1, when the new fiscal year begins and stringent budget ceilings become operative. The money the House approved, by a vote of 203 to 197, would be counted as a 1986 expenditure and so would escape the new limitations. PHILIPPINE AID PLAN FACING UNCERTAINTY ON THE SENATE FLOOR"

1982,"  49 ARTISTS CAPTURE THE ILLUSIONS AND REALITIES OF WINTER By HELEN A. HARRISON EAST HAMPTON ''WINTERSCAPE,'' the current exhibition at Guild Hall, features many paintings that relate to the East End in winter, as well as works that refer to the season in abstract terms or deal with other locales. A quiet, contemplative mood permeates the galleries, induced by the cool tones and restrained compositions that predominate. The effect is far from somber, however, for the 49 invited artists offer much that is delightful and captivating, even in its understatement.   A snow scene like ''Trap Hunting'' by Paul Georges, in which sketchy, almost offhand brushwork camouflages an extremely subtle and well-handled composition, or Ian Hornak's ''Sunrise, Winter,'' filled with sharp, clear light and melting shadow, is obviously directly related to the show's theme. Despite their very different methods of handling paint, both artists present a recognizable winter landscape, translated and adapted, but recognizable nonetheless. Even the less specific landscape evocations, such as Elwood Carr Howell's ''Prairie 37,'' with its abstract pattern of blotted paint implying a snowy field, and ''Late Day Silence,'' Jimmy Ernst's icy marsh grasses reflected in frozen water, are clearly relevant.

The winning shot came in the seventh inning off Ray Burris, a reliever.   The right-handed hitter faced Burris, also a right-hander, in the seventh inning after the Mets had chased Rogers with a three-run rally in the sixth. After 232 times at bat in the majors without a homer, Gardenhire hit a two-run shot to give the Mets a 5-4 lead. The victory was credited to a rookie sidearm reliever, Terry Leach, who allowed three hits in four innings . METS DEFEAT EXPOS"

1982,"  The president of the New York Public Library was standing at his desk, routinely going through his mail one recent morning, when he came across an enclosure that made him sit down, stupefied.   ''I thought it was a check for $10,000,'' the official, Dr. Vartan Gregorian, said later. ''Then I looked again and it was a check for $1 million.''   The check came from the estate of William C. Helmle, an engineer and an evidently modest man about whom little is known. According to his lawyer, Mr. Helmle worked for the American Telephone and Telegraph Company for 31 years and retired some time in the 1950's.  He died childless in 1979 at the age of 84.

The Congressional budget process and restraint supposedly created by the 1974 act seem to be foundering.   The fiscal year 1982 is three months old and there is no final budget resolution limiting how much Congress may spend. The lawmakers have been stunned by President Reagan's repeated proposals to cut nonmilitary spending.

The fashions that have swept in from the East represent a totally different attitude toward how clothes should look from that long established here. They aim to conceal, not reveal the body. They do not try to seduce through color or texture. They cannot be described in conventional terms because their shape is fluid, just as their proportions are overscale. Where the hemline is placed, or where the waistline is marked is simply immaterial.   On the official calendar of fall and winter showings, 12 of the 68 designers presenting collections here are Japanese.

1982,"  IT took the Metropolitan Opera nearly a century to get around to staging Mozart's ''Idomeneo,'' possibly the greatest work of its Baroque type ever written, but they got it right the first time. For sheer depth of vocal talent, grasp of the grand style and impressive decor, last night's first performance of Jean-Pierre Ponnelle'sproduction stood up to the best things the Met has given us in recent years.   The Metropolitan had a strong hand to play, with Ileana Cotrubas as the Princess Ilia, Frederica von Stade in the trouser part of Idamante, Hildegard Behrens as a fiery Elettra, John Alexander as Arbace and Luciano Pavarotti in the title role. Timothy Jenkins was a big-voiced High Priest, too, although his upper notes tended to be nasal and strained. Each of the principals had several big arias as well as important contributions to make in ensemble numbers and nobody seriously disappointed.

1982,"  EURIPIDES has a strong ally in Zoe Caldwell, who brought her special flame to the otherwise routine revival of ''Medea'' that opened last night at the Cort. Possibly the most modern of Greek dramatists, Euripides demands an intense psychological realism from actors - and that is what Miss Caldwell has bestowed on her marathon role. This actress makes us believe in the warped logic by which Medea murders her two sons to wreak vengeance on Jason, the ambitious husband who has betrayed her for a Greek princess. And because she does, we are, by evening's end, brought right into the thunderclap of Euripides' tragedy.   As befits a barbaric sorceress lost in exile, Miss Caldwell is set off from the rest of the company by her swarthy complexion; her eyes are dark horizontal slashes that summon up an exotic East. There is a seething physicality to her every gesture; mercurial and sinuous, she is indeed, as Robinson Jeffers's adaptation has it, a mixture of ''serpent and wolf.'' Yet she is a woman, too. Though Miss Caldwell has many opportunities to chew up the scenery, she usually resists them by shading her portrayal with carefully considered nuances.  This at times almost Hedda-like Medea makes the lineage from Euripides to Ibsen abundantly clear. THEATER: ZOE CALDWELL PLAYS MEDEA"

1984,"  SOME years ago in Paris, Gene Wilder remembers, the subject of remakes came up during a visit with the great director Jean Renoir.    ''One of the things he said to me,'' Mr. Wilder recalls, ''was that in the collaborative arts, such as films and theater, prizes and medals should be given out to directors who will take a really good story that means something to them and filter it through their own vision and do it in another country.''   As director, writer and star of ''The Woman in Red,'' playing at the Beekman and other theaters, Mr. Wilder has been addressing himself to the subject of remakes, because the movie is actually a remake of the 1977 French comedy ''Pardon Mon Affaire,'' directed by Yves Robert.   The film deals with the turmoil of a married man who falls madly in love with a beautiful young woman, and Mr. Wilder explained the story's appeal to him by saying: ''I thought it was more American than French. In America, if a married man has an affair, falls in love or is obsessed with another woman, he's so riddled with guilt, he tries to make the woman into something she isn't. We don't have the institution of mistress to the extent they had in France.'' AT THE MOVIES"

 I am summoned from my bed 
 To the Great City of the Dead 
 Where I have no house or home 
 But in dreams may sometime roam 
 Looking for my ancient room 
 A feeling in my heart of doom, 
 Where Grandmother ag ed lies 
 In her couch of later days 
 And my mother saner than I 
 Laughs and cries She's still alive. I found myself again in the Great Eastern Metropolis, wandering under Elevated Transport's iron struts - many-windowed apartments walled the crowded Bronx road-way under old theater roofs, masses of poor women shopping in black shawls past candy store news stands, children skipped beside grandfathers bent tottering on their canes. I'd descended to this same street from blackened subways Sundays long ago, tea and lox with my aunt and dentist cousin when I was ten. The living pacifist David Dellinger walked at my right side, he'd driven from Vermont to visit Catholic Worker Tivoli Farm, we rode up North Manhattan in his car, relieved the U.S. wars were over in the newspaper, Television's frenzied dance of dots & shadows calmed - Now older than our shouts and banners, we explored brick avenues we lived in to find new residences, rent loft offices or roomy apartments, retire our eyes & ears & thoughts. Surprised, I passed the open Chamber where my Russian Jewish Grandmother lay in her bed and sighed eating a little Chicken soup or borsht, potato lotkes, crumbs on her blankets, talking Yiddish, complaining solitude abandoned in Old Folks House.

Prices have dropped so far and so fast that consumers will pay much less for energy on average this year than last, even if the cartel of major oil exporting nations were to succeed soon in pushing petroleum prices back up again.

However, consumers, investors, and policy makers alike should pause before they extrapolate headlines about declining oil prices into expectations of an extended era of cheap energy and low inflation. These benefits are likely to be temporary. Besides, oil prices are likely to rebound by next year.

1993,"  The Federal Reserve said today that the main yardstick it used in guiding the economy's growth for more than 15 years had become so unreliable that it would largely abandon it.    Alan Greenspan, the central bank's chairman, said the Federal Reserve would stop relying on growth in the money supply -- its traditional tool -- and begin relying on interest rates, an approach more akin to the way it worked before it started relying on the money supply figures.  Changes in Investments    In an appearance before the Senate Banking Committee today, Mr. Greenspan said the central bank was jettisoning the money supply approach because changes in the way Americans invest their money meant it could no longer predict how much economic growth would be produced by a certain amount of growth in the money supply.

1986,"  ''THE FLOOD,'' a ''musical play'' created especially for the television medium, is one of the last major works of Igor Stravinsky (indeed, of the music from the composer's final decade, only the ''Requiem Canticles'' is of equal magnitude). Esteemed by some critics, ''The Flood'' has never been popular. ''Its world premiere on June 14, 1962, by way of a CBS telecast, was the only event during Stravinsky's 80th birthday year that did not bring him ovations,'' Lillian Libman writes in her memoir, ''And Music at the Close.'' She continues: ''As for Stravinsky's score, it was so surrounded by Breck Golden Showcase commercials, and a hodgepodge of documentary film clips, eulogies, flood legends, and rehearsal excerpts, plus an introductory minor epic rivalling the speech of Polonius in pomposity, no amount of concentration could afford it a fair hearing.'' The press was generally negative. ''The hour as a whole was enough to retard the progress of the arts in this country by a great deal,'' wrote The New York Times. ''Literature, music, art objects, and by implication their creators, were made to seem insufferably pretentious, disorganized and dull.'' BRAVO PRESENTS STRAVINSKY'S 'FLOOD'"

The truth is that the people of New York hardly ever know what's happening on budgetary matters that deeply concern them. Despite the electorate's declaration last November that business-as-usual isn't good enough, business-as-usual in New york means secrecy-as-usual. In other states, and Washington, D.C., budget proceedings have become increasingly visible. In New York, the political powers still negotiate behind doors. Budgeting in the Dark"

1984,"   A regulation banning ''happy hours'' at bars and restaurants went into effect throughout Massachusetts today amid hopes that the elimination of promotions that offer special low-priced alcoholic drinks would reduce the incidence of drunken driving.     The ban, one of several steps that Massachusetts has taken lately against alcohol-related accidents, is believed the first such rule to cover an entire state. Many of the regulation's supporters hope the idea will spread.    ''I've heard all the horror stories I'm going to listen to,'' said George R. McCarthy, chairman of the Massachusetts Alcoholic Beverage Control Commission, which sponsored the ban. He was referring to several recent cases in which drivers and pedestrians were killed after having been drinking during tavern happy hours. 'HAPPY HOUR' BAN STARTS IN MASSACHUSETTS BARS"

By Sheila Cudahy.
Sun & Moon Press, paper, $11.95. 

 When it comes to searching for love, the protagonists of these thoughtful stories know where not to look -- to the people who are closest to them. In ""Boy,"" a son discovers that his feckless father is not the war hero he made himself out to be; in ""Minna's Woods,"" a woman silently battles her husband for the family's soul. Finding parents and lovers selfish, self-involved or simply absent, Sheila Cudahy's characters turn to unexpected friends: an elderly neighbor, a senile mother-in-law, a doll. Even other species sometimes prove more generous than their human counterparts. In ""The Listeners,"" a woman befriends a talented, seemingly sensitive violinist, only to realize he has less essential empathy than the mice drawn out of the woodwork by his playing. In ""Peak,"" perhaps the most poignant of the stories, a man mistreated by his family escapes to the woods and finds a companion -- a wolf. Some of the stories (a few are mere one-page sketches) take more fantastic turns: ""A Shoe, a Fable"" expands the fairy tale about the old woman who lived in a shoe, while ""Calcutta Connections"" features two illicit lovers who, in the middle of their affair, are literally struck by the suffering of those in far-off countries -- which pierces the woman in the form of an arrow. While these experiments can be playful and intriguing, Ms. Cudahy is at her best in the more realistic stories, observing the makeshift and yet still marvelous ways in which people go about getting what they think they need.

1992,"  Any band with a drummer in a kilt who comes out from behind his drums, lies down on the stage and keeps time with his sticks while the guitarist, also lying on his back, plays a quiet psychedelic interlude, his legs swaying gently in the air above his head, deserves a hearty round of applause. The Dentists, from Kent, England, are such a band, and at CBGB on Wednesday night they got the crowd response they had earned. Except for the drummer, the Dentists all look as if they could be dentists on holiday: short haircuts sprinkled with gray, striped polo shirts, goofy striped boxer shorts. They played with admirable passion and abandon, as if they never wanted to go back to their day jobs.    The music was a punky, fuzzy takeoff of 1960's guitar-pop, with trippy, good-natured songs like ""Strawberries Are Growing in My Garden (and It's Wintertime)."" A Dentists compilation, ""Dressed,"" is available on the Long Island-based independent label Homestead Records, which sponsored the CBGB showcase as part of the New Music Seminar. Also on the bill were Love Child, a post-Nirvana grunge band with a completely incompetent rhythm section and two singers, one male and one female, neither of whom could sing; and the Cake Kitchen, a politely droning neo-psychedelic band from New Zealand.

1985,"  THE 10-MONTH SUIT, WHICH WEIGHS BE-tween 8 and 11 ounces per linear yard of fabric, is the mainstay of a man's wardrobe. It is to the suit what the blazer is to sport coats.   Usually made of worsted wools such as gabardine, whipcord, serge, tropicals, sharkskin or flannel, it is versatile, comfortable and practical. It can be worn in all but the coldest months. Indeed, some men, given the temperamental nature of office heating machinery, prefer it year-round. Without a vest, this suit is a good choice for the Labor Day transition from summer to fall. (Although tradition has it that summer's cotton poplins, seersuckers, and linens are stowed away after Labor Day, the weather rarely cooperates and many men continue wearing summer-weight clothing well into September.) The fabric for 10-month suits - pure lightweight wool or a wool blended with rayon or polyester - is said to ''breathe.'' This simply means that it has the ability to absorb moisture in hot weather, thereby keeping the body cool, and to retain heat close to the body in cold weather.   ALL-PURPOSE SUITS"

1991,"  He's not your idea of anybody's Uncle Charlie. Brooding, volatile -- a serial killer, in fact -- he comes from the East to move in with his sister Emma and her family in Santa Rosa, Calif. Somehow it all seems so normal in Alfred Hitchcock's ""Shadow of a Doubt"" (1943) with Joseph Cotten.   With its Hitchcockian touches and twists, ""Shadow of a Doubt"" might not seem like a prime candidate for a remake. In fact, remaking    any    Hitchcock film might not seem like the best way to further a career. Some movie makers occasionally pay homage from afar (Danny DeVito's ""Throw Momma From the Train,"" loosely based on Hitchcock's ""Strangers on a Train,"" is one example). But rare is the attempt to duplicate the master.  A Shift in Decades     Sunday at 9 P.M. on CBS , however, the ""Hallmark Hall of Fame"" will present a remake of ""Shadow of a Doubt,"" this time directed by Karen Arthur and starring Mark Harmon as Uncle Charlie and Diane Ladd as Emma. How does one go about remaking Hitchcock? For one thing, the decades have been changed. Shot in black and white, the original was set in the 40's.

Testifying before the House Ways and Means Committee, the Governor sought to rebut the contention by the President and his supporters that the deduction for state and local taxes needed to be repealed so that taxpayers from states with low taxes would not have to subsidize those from high-tax states such as New York.   ''Let me answer that with some questions of my own,'' declared Mr. Cuomo, one of the most prominent opponents of repealing the state and local deductions. ''Is it right that the residents of New Jersey spend their money to subsidize farmers in Iowa? Why do Iowans contribute to mass transit in New Jersey? Why do the people of Alabama help build dams in the Northwest? And why do people in the Northwest help construct the Tennessee-Tombigbee waterway?'' CUOMO TAKES CASE TO HOUSE"

2006,"In ''American Dreamz,'' a comedy about a faltering American president, a wildly popular TV talent show and the Svengalis behind them both, the jokes don't just fizzle into insignificance; they flop about with gaudy ineffectualness, gasping for air like newly landed trout. Unlike fish, alas, gags about nitwit commanders in chief, oily television hosts and rabidly ambitious young performers with stars in their eyes and sometimes their beds can't be tossed back in the water; only a blunt instrument, like a hammer, will do. Consider this a hammer, humanely but firmly applied.      Written and directed by Paul Weitz, whose earlier films include the boomer-revenge fantasy ''In Good Company'' and, with his brother, Chris Weitz, the sleekly entertaining adaptation of Nick Hornby's novel ''About a Boy,'' ''American Dreamz'' is a seriously unfunny comedy about a seriously juicy subject, namely that intersection where politics meets entertainment. This isn't new, of course; Aristophanes bummed around that juncture, as did Elia Kazan. But what gives the film its gleam of topicality, its suggestion of relevance, is that it directly sends up both the Bush presidency and ''American Idol,'' those twin pillars of contemporary homespun populism. The problem being that, as Jon Stewart, among many others, habitually reminds us, both surrendered to self-parody some time ago.

1984,"  Atheneum Publishers is observing its 25th anniversary this season.  More than most, the middle sized trade book house symbolizes the constants and changes in the modern world of publishing: the effort to remain independent, the different means of survival within larger companies, and the chancy game of briging books before the American reader in the electronic age.   The latest development in the continuing saga of Atheneum occurred recently in the form of an internal memorandum written by Charles Scribner Jr., chairman of the Scribner Book Companies (which embraces Charles Scribner's Sons, Atheneum Publishers and Rawson Associates).  It said that Alfred Knopf Jr., co-founder and longtime head of Atheneum, would assume ''publishing responsibility'' for all the adult hardcover and trade paperback books put out by the Sribner Book Companies.

The Ways and Means bill would achieve universal coverage; but the rest of it is a farce, incorporating ruinous amendments virtually dictated by the American Medical Association.   The political calendar will not permit more dawdling and posturing. The committees must complete most of their work this week.

The schedule:

 Good teams need to play each other more often. And lopsided matchups must be avoided. (Doesn't it seem like the Giants play the Redskins and Cowboys six times each during the season, while seldom meeting fellow soft touches like the Buccaneers and Oilers?) The solution: Don't set the schedule in advance. Rather, just like on the playground, if you win one week, the next week you play another winner. And, of course, losers play losers. Each week, Pete Rozelle would draw the new matchups from an official NFL souvenir helmet. This method would give doormats like the Giants and the Oilers a shot at the playoffs.

Steinfelder, the company's executive vice president and one of the six private investors who pooled the initial capital four years ago, little worry that the venture will fail.    Mr. Steinfelder, whose company has no ties to any Swiss concern, is one of a growing number of entrepreneurs seeking to exploit what they see as a potentially big business: private safe-deposit centers outside of banks.

The sense of recognition among the frogs-to-be was so strong that tadpoles raised in isolation since hatching could zero in on both their full and half siblings days and even weeks later, the scientists reported. They also found that even if the tadpoles were raised among unrelated tadpoles from the beginning, they could still identify their own kin later. TADPOLES' STRONG KINSHIP AWARENESS"

He served on the panel while many actions were taken of particular importance to reactors in the New York area, including those at Indian Point in Westchester County, Shoreham on Long Island and Salem in southern New Jersey.

I'm not optimistic or sanguine about the nuclear power industry as a successful industry in the United States.  There are a couple of factors that would change that. One is an increase in demand.

Mr. Kreuger, a mechanical engineer from Kalmar, Sweden, was among the world's most powerful industrialists back in the 1920's, when he supplied 75 percent of the world's matches from factories in 34 countries.   His dream was to be the producer of every match on the face of the earth. So in exchange for monopolies on match production, he loaned enormous amounts of money to more than a dozen nations. At the same time, his empire grew as he bought everything from banks, film companies and railways to gold mines and forests. He also built a 125-room office in Stockholm, which became known as the Match Palace. Ivar Kreuger: Sweden's Match King"

1982,"  THE New York recital debut of Kihwa Jin, a Korean-born soprano, Monday night at the Merkin Concert Hall asked a lot of the accompanist, Raymond Beegle, whose piano had to masquerade as the orchestra of Richard Strauss's ''Four Last Songs,'' Berlioz's ''Les nuits d'ete,'' Korngold's ''Die tote Stadt'' and Puccini's ''La Rondine.''

Two weeks ago, about 15,000 people, the vast majority between 16 and 25 years of age, gathered in the concert field of bucolic Waterloo Village in Stanhope, N.J. They were nice folks in clean T-shirts, halter tops, shorts, jeans and mass-market punkwear; even the buzzcuts were designer-styled. When someone bumped into someone else, as happens at sold-out rock concerts, polite ""Excuse me's"" were traded.   The fans had congregated, however, for nine hours of howling, bawling, shouting and wailing, for denunciations of everything from self-pity to police brutality to parental abandonment, and they yelled affirmation when Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails groaned, ""I hate everybody!"" or Ice-T sang, ""I'm a cop killer!""

1983,"  IN New York, there is a Christmas less obvious than the window displays along Fifth Avenue, the Christmas tree in Rockefeller Center    and the tree under the arch in Washington Square. But, New York's   hidden Christmas, unlike that in many cities, is not only the sum total of many small, personal expressions - like the tinsel wrapped around a trash can at Fifth Avenue and Eighth Street or a fire escape decorated in Christmas lights on Avenue D and Houston Street. It is also the Christmas that is almost too large to see.   At night, from certain angles, the towers of New York evoke the trees of a forest, especially since some of them, such as the Empire State, Con Ed and Metropolitan Life Insurance buildings, make the point explicitly through their illumination.   The skyscrapers suggest that part of New York's Christmas is a macro-Christmas. When people come out of the Cloisters in Fort Tryon Park at twilight, with Christmas on their minds after a late afternoon of medieval seasonal music, the lights strung between the towers of the George Washington Bridge start to look like Christmas lights. The holidays somehow alter our perception of the city. CITY SIGHTS: HOLIDAY SURPRISES WORTH LOOKING FOR"

1991,"  The opening event of the annual benefit series presented by Performance Space 122 last week was like a crash course in the performance art of the 1980's. But the very forces that have rendered much of those 80's antics almost offensively irrelevant may also be toughening the avant-garde for the 90's, lending it a resonance and a seriousness it has so grievously lacked. In short, tragedy may make for better art than rampant greed and trivial hedonism.    Some background on the benefit: P.S. 122 is one of five avant-garde institutions housed in the former Public School 122 on First Avenue at Ninth Street. Like Franklin Furnace, it has become one of the premier forums for the performance art that proliferated in the East Village in Manhattan over the last decade. Much of that art tested normal boundaries of propriety, and as a result became a prime target for the religious right in its fulminations against the National Endowment for the Arts.    P.S. 122 still lists the endowment as a supporter, but it deliberately -- heroically, even -- courts confrontation with the agency's new ""decency"" guidelines. Last week's benefit opener offered Annie Sprinkle as host. Ms. Sprinkle is the porn actress turned performance artist whose past appearances have included inviting the audience to examine her vagina through a gynecological instrument.    But there was a good deal more than just Ms. Sprinkle and her privates. There was Diamanda Galas, stripped to the waist and covered with a convincing likeness of blood, howling and screaming in agony, as is her wont. Bebe Miller and three of her fine dancers contributed an athletic excerpt from a larger work in progress. John Kelly did a fey falsetto imitation of Byronic poetic lassitude, too lightly flavored with camp, in an aria from Bellini's ""Sonnambula."" Pat Oleszko cavorted in one of her remarkably elaborate costumes. Eric Bogosian told stories, and Julee Cruise repeated her kewpie-doll chanteuse act, singing or lip-synching to her album, which is mostly soundtrack music from ""Twin Peaks"" with words by David Lynch and music by Angelo Badalamenti, both uncredited.      For one who never fully accepted the East Village bar-scene, fun-and-games performance-art esthetic, in which young people tarted themselves up in unattractive ways and acted out sexually provocative charades, the P.S. 122 benefit was like a farewell to a not-very-appealing era. If the 80's were defined by manic acquisitiveness and self-gratification uptown, the decade's downtown mirror was this performance art scene, formalized at publicly supported spaces like P.S. 122. Its denizens may have thought they were making trenchant comment upon Donald Trump and Michael R. Milken, but in a disturbing way they were acting out those same vulgar, exhibitionistic fantasies on an underground level.    As the 80's advanced, however, AIDS turned the party into a nightmare. AIDS is a tragedy that transcends America and its artists. But in the East Village Bohemia of the 80's, where sexual experimentation and heroin both played a larger role than in most sectors of society, the disease hit with a terrifying vengeance.    Now the Persian Gulf war has come along, with an as yet undetermined effect on our traditionally left-leaning artistic vanguard. So far, that effect has been fragmented, with the left confused by contradictory impulses. But artists voice concerns before the rest of society, and horror at war and death already looms large among those who took part in the P.S. 122 benefit.    All of this cast the evening into a rather different light than one might have expected from what was, after all, a celebratory gala. One need not subscribe to the implied conspiracy theories of Mr. Bogosian -- ""What does the gulf war have in common with AIDS? Everything"" -- to sense the impassioned concern that has transformed the East Village community.    The shift in vanguard sensibilities could be observed most clearly in the case of Ms. Sprinkle.     Not that she has been fully tamed, or turned into some politically prim and proper propagandist. While she didn't invite us to peer at her genitalia, she did allude to all manner of questionably attractive people doing mildly gross things, and she did perform her ""bosom ballet,"" in which she jiggles and manipulates her breasts in time to bouncy ballet music.    But this time, at least, there was more to Ms. Sprinkle than a rather ordinary, overweight woman flaunting her wares. It was her principal monologue that defined the new agenda facing artists today. After a parade of slides of her lovers, in all shapes and races and sizes and sexual inclinations, the mood darkened. Lover after lover, it turned out, had died of AIDS; descriptions of their attributes and endowments shifted to the past tense. What had been happily hedonistic became a funeral procession of martyrs to the cause, the cause being a community's search, through sexual liberation and artistic license, for anarchic bliss.    One could argue that her success, her ability to move her audience and make it feel her pain, was inadvertent, provided not by her art but by the somber foil of our time. But wittingly or unwittingly, her transformation of sexual celebration into a litany of death provided a focus for what could have been an otherwise disparate benefit evening, a focus that turned all the artists involved into voices for their generation.

1984,"   Rowntree Mackintosh P.L.C. has torn down old warehouses here to build a manufacturing plant for KitKat, the chocolate wafer bar that is its biggest seller.    But even while the factory is going up, with the expectation that it will help improve efficiency and increase production in Britain, executives of this chocolate and sugar confectionery business are concentrating their hopes for future growth on North America.    ''It's such a huge market - strategically, that's why we like to be there,'' explained Kurt Haslinger, the company's deputy chairman, who oversees Rowntree's operations in the United States and spends about 10 days a month there.    Rowntree's recently announced pretax profits indicate how much the company has come to rely on its North American holdings. The United States and Canada accounted for 46 percent of the first half's profits of $28 million, which were up about 25 percent from the same period in 1983. Rowntree's sales increased one-third in the first six month of the year, to nearly $600 million. And a stronger second half is expected. ROWNTREE EXPANSION IS SOUGHT"

1982,"  IN THE quiet hills of Rockland County, N.Y., Dr. Rafael Capella is performing a relatively new operation that has attracted as much controversy within the medical profession as it has patients eager to try the procedure.   ''Gastroplasty,'' a surgical technique pioneered by doctors at the University of Iowa in 1971, attacks the problem of morbid obesity by sealing off, or stapling, all but about two ounces of the stomach into a small pouch, with a small channel leading to the rest of the stomach.   Although the university discarded such surgery as imperfect in the mid-1970's, it was revived by Dr. Cesar Gomez of St. Louis University later in the decade. Gradual improvements determined the appropriate size of the small pouch and the channel, which had caused problems, and after studying Dr. Gomez's technique, Dr. Capella began performing the operations about two years ago.

1996,"To the Editor: I found the Practical Traveler column ""To Regulate Agents or Not"" (Jan. 21) somewhat disturbing. I entirely disagree with the prominence it provided to comments from travel industry lobbyists. Their premise that state legislation in this domain has been overly hasty is self-serving. It helps only  to perpetuate the fragmented state of regulation, which nurtured the Milestone Educational Institute debacle in 1993. The abrupt default of Milestone, a Massachusetts student tour operator, caused 4,462 students and teachers to lose  $7.8 million. according to the State Attorney General.         I note no suggestion of a need for powerful and responsive Federal intervention to protect consumers from travel fraud. The unfortunate fact is that state-level regulation can in no way cope with interstate operators. It certainly cannot speedily respond to the failure of an agent to provide time-sensitive travel services for which the traveler has paid in advance. Industry attempts at self-regulation seem entirely out of proportion to the evident harm to consumers.    Regulating Travel"

1991,"  A '93 Sequel to 'Catch-22'   Simon & Schuster recently signed Joseph Heller's proposed sequel to ""Catch-22."" The novel, as yet untitled, is due in the spring of 1993.    Mr. Heller had originally signed in 1987 to write the novel for G. P. Putnam's, as part of a $4 million, two-novel contract. Phyllis Grann, the chief executive of the Putnam Berkley Group Inc., said yesterday that Mr. Heller and the house dissolved their contract for the sequel two years ago because Mr. Heller decided he was not prepared to begin writing.  In 1988, however, Putnam's published the first book under that contract, ""Picture This,"" which Robert M. Adams, in The New York Times Book Review, described as ""a set of reflections on the loosely related themes of war and its stupidity, justice and the lack of it, money, and government.""   ""We parted enormously amicably,"" Mrs. Grann said. ""In fact, Joe is doing a nonfiction book for us.""   Faith Sale, Mr. Heller's editor at Putnam, said the nonfiction book was being written with Speed Vogel, the longtime friend with whom Mr. Heller wrote ""No Laughing Matter"" (Putnam's, 1986). The new book, also untitled, will be about Mr. Heller's poor childhood in Brooklyn and Mr. Vogel's comfortable childhood in Manhattan. As for the delivery date of that book, Mrs. Sale said only, ""It's in the works."" Mr. Heller's agent, Amanda Urban, declined to confirm reports that Mr. Heller would receive a $750,000 advance from Simon & Schuster. Two From Virginia Woolf     Virginia Woolf is having a renaissance of sorts, 50 years after her death. A volume of her early journals, ""A Passionate Apprentice,"" edited by Mitchell Leaska, was published this month by Harcourt Brace Jovanovich , and next month Harcourt will publish a children's book, ""Nurse Lugton's Curtain."" That book, written for Woolf's niece, was found among the pages of the manuscript for her novel ""Mrs. Dalloway.""    ""A Room of One's Own,"" based on the 1929 book that became a favorite of feminists, opens on Monday at the Lamb's Theater in Manhattan, with previews beginning tomorrow night.  The one-woman show, which had a successful run in Britain, is produced by Arthur Cantor and adapted by Patrick Garland, who also directs.  Eileen Atkins plays Woolf.   Rubin Pfeffer, the managing director of the trade department of Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, which published its first Virginia Woolf title in 1921, said Harcourt had 41 of her titles in print, including five volumes of her diaries. It also has at least a dozen titles by such other members of the Bloomsbury group as E. M. Forster, Leonard Woolf, Lytton Strachey, Vita Sackville-West and John Maynard Keynes -- writers who followedWoolf to Harcourt and remained there.   Altogether, more than two million copies of books by the Bloomsbury group are in print from Harcourt, Mr. Pfeffer said. More than 200,000 copies were sold last year, including 50,000 copies of ""A Room of One's Own."" A Word-of-Mouth Hit     It took Kevin Costner's motion picture to transform ""Dances With Wolves"" (Fawcett) by Michael Blake into a No. 1 best seller, but another book about Indians -- ""The Education of Little Tree"" by Forrest Carter -- has enjoyed huge sales recently with nothing more than the publicity that comes from word-of-mouth. For the last two years the 15-year-old book has been the best-selling title from the University of New Mexico Press , and since 1986 it has sold almost 250,000 copies in paperback. In April the press will print an additional 100,000 copies. Any of those numbers would please a commercial press, much less an academic press that specializes in anthropology, archeology and Western history.    The book, an account of the author's boyhood with his Cherokee grandparents in the Appalachian mountains of Tennessee, was published in hard-cover 15 years ago by Delacorte/Eleanor Friede.

2001,"RADIOHEAD:  ''I Might Be Wrong: Live Recordings'' (Capitol). It has been interesting to watch Radiohead's live concerts evolve from manic twitching affairs to symphonies of stillness. This eight-song album captures the latter, mostly with songs from the band's previous two recordings. Just as a concert can sometimes open up a band's album and make it more accessible, this live album strips away the production and studio effects to reveal the songs lurking behind some of the soundscapes on these albums. It also features a live acoustic version of an unreleased favorite, ''True Love Waits.'' Despite its relatively short length, this album actually works as an addition to the evolving oeuvre of this band, and is just as intense a listening experience as some of its previous albums, especially when paired with the bootleg of the band performing acoustic versions of their songs.

In the film — which a synopsis says is about a traveling theater troupe that tempts its audiences with the chance to “transcend mundane reality by passing through a magical mirror into a fantastic universe of limitless imagination” — Mr. Ledger was playing a character who is transported into three separate dimensions. These will now be inhabited, instead, by Mr. Depp, Mr. Law and Mr. Farrell. Three Actors Replace Heath Ledger"

1995,"  Bob Dorsi has lived all his 73 years in Long Hill Township, in Morris County; 50 years ago next year, he founded the Dorsi Deli and Pharmacy, and it has become a Long Hill landmark and clearinghouse for local gossip. Now that his sons, Robert Jr. and Tom, are running the business, Mr. Dorsi had time to answer some questions about his hometown.   Q.  So what's Long Hill like?   A.  We've got a little of everything. We have wooded areas. We've got the Passaic River, and we've got the Great Swamp, which runs into Long Hill and Chatham and Madison. People are always running and bicycle riding, especially in the summer, when a lot of people come from the city and get off at the train station with their packs.   Before, we had Italian and Polish and Armenian people, mostly. Now, it's just mixed. We're just getting better people all the time -- better educated, more money. We don't have anyone here who's that famous. Leo the Lion, the MGM symbol, was pretty heavy here about a year ago. People came from all over to see where he was buried. Now it's died out; I heard the owners took the headstone away because they want to sell the property.   Q.  What are people in Long Hill talking about these days?   A.  A few years ago, the new people didn't like the name Passaic Township, which was what Long Hill was called for a long time. So there was a vote, and people changed the name to Long Hill. Long Hill sounds a little richer, like Short Hills. People used to get us confused with Passaic, over there near Clifton. The old people didn't like this when the name changed; they never said Passaic Township, they just said Millington, Stirling, Gillette, Meyersville or Homestead Park -- those are the villages that are part of Long Hill. But now you never hear anything about Passaic. People say either Long Hill or Stirling or Gillette.   Property is worth a lot of money here, and people are worried about all the stores coming in now, like T.J. Maxx and Dunkin' Donuts and McDonald's. All the land is just about saturated. They're building a new development now -- Stirling Manor, I think it's called. They're going to build about 60 homes on the hill, and the cheapest you can get is $375,000.   Q.  Has the town changed?   A.  Years ago, you knew everyone by their first name, their last name, where they lived. Now you don't know. You do meet a lot of nice people; we've got a lot of lawyers, dentists and doctors and F.B.I. people. You see almost the same people every day, and you try to talk to them a little. We have the lottery here at the store; that brings in a lot of people. It's just that everybody's in a hurry.   TV and the malls have changed a lot of people. These new people have got a landscaper and a gardener; they sleep late on Sunday, take the kids to the mall, stay all day. It isn't like when families got up early, went together to get a bun or rolls, got the morning paper, went back home and read it at home. We open at 6:30 every day. The early birds are all old-timers coming in for coffee, doughnuts and rolls. We try to satisfy everybody; that's what kept me here so long. I want to retire, but my sons always need help. It's O.K.; I've got to do something. DAVID W. CHEN Changes Come to Long Hill Township, Starting With the Name"

My answer was that when it comes to fish and shellfish it seems to me that this nation has an embarrassment of riches. I know that almost anything out of the sea - provided it is freshly harvested - is delectable with even the simplest treatment.

The Senate is bound to approve this appointment, and the Soviets have expressed delight. In brief, the issue is settled, except perhaps for the philosophical question of what ambassadors are good for these days.    Mr. Strauss will be an excellent adviser to Soviet leaders, telling them what they can, and cannot, realistically expect from Washington. He will have unparalleled access to the White House and Congress. But access for what? At this point, alas, certain questions arise: isn't something basically flawed with a system in which an individual is picked because he has ""access""?

1985,"  JOHANNESBURG     WHEN Julian Ogilvie Thompson discusses his new role as chairman of De Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd., one of the world's most secretive and successful cartels, he lards the conversation with notions like stability, continuity and order.    The suggestion seems to be that, while the dynastic tradition of direct Oppenheimer family stewardship of a huge slice of the diamond business has been broken, or at least interrupted, by his rise to power, its spirit lives on in the somewhat patrician 51-year- old executive, whose urbaneness seems designed to lend a sense of style to what is otherwise a rough and tumble market.    Mr. Ogilvie Thompson, whose presence seems imbued with the same qualities that he seeks for the market he now oversees, is a product of the closed world of the Oppenheimer family. Its elder statesman, 76-year- old Harry Oppenheimer, last month relinquished the chairmanship of De Beers to Mr. Ogilvie Thompson, two years after stepping down at the umbilically linked Anglo American Corporation. De Beers, which controls four-fifths of the world's diamond trade through its subsidiary, the London-based Central Selling Organization, had been founded by his father, Sir Ernest Oppenheimer.

The triumph tied the three-offive-game Stanley Cup playoff series at 1-1, with the third game to be played Saturday at the Spectrum in Philadelphia.   The six assists broke one National Hockey League record, tied another, and broke two Ranger records, all for a single playoff game.

His 6 points tied the league record held by four others - Dickie Moore, Phil Esposito, Guy Lafleur and Darryl Sittler. Sittler played last night for the Flyers but had no points. Leinonen also broke the Ranger record of 4 points in a playoff game, set by Frank Boucher in 1932 and matched by three others; and the Ranger assist record of 4, set by Jean Ratelle in 1971.

1982,"  WITH landscapes at the Museum Gallery of the White Plains Public Library and figure paintings at the College of New Rochelle's Castle Gallery, ''Contemporary Realism'' is now in full cry. This tripleheader, which includes a display of still lifes in The Gallery at Hastings-on-Hudson that was recently reviewed by John Caldwell, is a triumph of collaboration between local nonprofit institutions and commercial dealers in Manhattan. It is also a welcome gust of professionalism on the Westchester scene, where normally art of this caliber is viewable only in museums.   The landscape show at White Plains, which closes Feb. 28, is particularly well chosen. It consists mainly of small- to mediumsized works, and several testify to the Impressionistic influence of the late Fairfield Porter. One example is Robert Dash's tilted view of a field heightened by the white towel that is draped over the fence of a house in the foreground. Porter himself is represented by a nice though not very distinguished study of a sunlit apple tree. Art; POOLING OF RESOURCES PRODUCES STIMULATING SUCCESS"

That same thought recently occurred to the Reagan Administration and a number of state governments.

Is the board's decision to charge selectively for storing bicycles legal? . . . Gail B. Kraushar, Manhattan.    A -- Mary L. Kosmark, a Manhattan co-op lawyer, said that the clause referred to by the letter writer is a fairly typical proprietary lease clause governing storage space.

They are a trio that ran heavily to exclamation marks in the titles, in the style of the times. The opener of this festival is ''Oh, Boy!'' with lyrics by P. G.

HAPPY HUNDRED In this year of big round-number musical anniversaries - 300th for Bach and Scarlatti, for instance - Jerome Kern, who would have been 100 years old on Sunday, is a comparative parvenu, a youngster and an American who composed some of the best scores for the musical-comedy theater.

(The animal characters have names like Gruffle, Hootie and Schnoodle, and the action is divided between Frankfurt and the Alps.) It begins when Heidi is brought to live at her grandfather's house, with the grandfather's blustery voice supplied by Lorne Greene.

1986,"  Following are excerpts from a Soviet Government statement today on arms control and the 1979 strategic arms treaty, as distributed in translation by the Soviet press agency Tass:   The Government of the United States has taken a step which again in all obviousness reveals the essence of the current U.S.A. foreign policy course aimed at spiraling up the arms race in every way, at militarizing outer space, and at heightening international tension.   On May 27 this year, President Reagan announced a virtual refusal of the United States to subsequently observe the Soviet-U.S. legal treaty documents on the limitation of strategic offensive arms - the 1972 interim agreement and the 1979 SALT II treaty. He stated that the United States would not be bound by strategic arms limitation agreements in future decisions concerning the development of U.S. strategic forces.   Thus, what the Soviet Union warned about has happened. The U.S. Administration, of all versions of its possible actions as regards the strategic arms limitation agreements, adopted precisely the one which undermines the foundation of the process of limiting and reducing such arms.

2005,"I watch too much TV. I know that everyone says that. But I have proof.     I was recently walking down Beverly Drive in Beverly Hills. It was a 90-degree Sunday afternoon. Two minutes earlier, I was consuming lunch at a Johnny Rockets diner that seemed completely misplaced among all the palm trees and architectural perfection. As I walked, I was quietly wondering if that diner was the model for the Peach Pit on ''Beverly Hills 90210.'' I didn't have a rental car (and absolutely no one else was sharing the sidewalk), and I was meandering toward Tiffany and Barneys, both of which were establishments I had previously experienced only through game shows like ''Sale of the Century.'' It was occurring to me that everything I thought I knew about Beverly Hills was a media construction and that I probably didn't understand Los Angeles as much as I once thought. And that was precisely the moment when an L.A. police car pulled up beside me and a semi-gargantuan cop jumped out.   As Seen on TV"
1998,"Getting a handle on Russia's economic activity is notoriously difficult because businesses routinely under-report their production to minimize taxes. The Government of Boris N. Yeltsin took a first step toward improving official economic estimates by arresting the country's top statisticians and accusing them of manipulating data to help Russian companies avoid taxes.    The International Monetary Fund, which told the Government it needed to slash its budget deficit and overhaul its tax system to qualify for billions of dollars in extra loans, says Russia's economic production is roughly 20 percent greater than official estimates.

1983,"  JOHN O'KEEFFE'S 18th-century comic romance ''Wild Oats'' is close to foolproof, but in its new production the Classic Stage Company is subjecting it to a stress test. The play's denouement is, as it should be, a euphoric unraveling of mistaken identity, paradise regained and virtue triumphant. There are coach stops along the way, however, when ''Wild Oats'' seems imperiled.   The play was rediscovered in 1976 by the Royal Shakespeare Company. Leading an ensemble tour de force was Alan Howard, who gave one of his richest performances as that genial rascal Jack Rover. Several years ago the enterprising C.S.C. offered its own rambunctious version. Now the C.S.C. artistic director, Christopher Martin, has taken the play for an altered, ragtag ride. As a framework, he uses actors as a chorus, somewhat in the manner of ''Nicholas Nickleby.'' Urchins loll around the stage, reacting to the dialogue and moving scenery. Though not harmful, this is at best unnecessary. THEATER: 'WILD OATS'"

Yang, a professor of Chinese studies at Seton Hall University in South Orange, N.J., Mr. Deng, China's senior Deputy Prime Minister, outlined his views on reunification with Taiwan, raising several new points and refining Peking's known position on Taiwan autonomy after reunification with the mainland. Mr. Deng said he hoped his statements would temper any fears the Taiwan Government had on starting negotiations on reunification.   ''We are reasonable, we are sensible and we are sincere,'' Mr. Yang quoted Mr. Deng as saying. TAIWAN COULD BUY ARMS ABROAD AFTER REUNIFICATION, DENG ASSERTS"
1986,"In the early 1960's, the Whitman Foundation led a successful campaign against a plan by the city of Camden to demolish the Walt Whitman home, owned at that time by the city.

1985,"  DEFENSE lawyers often attack the plaintiffs' bar for ''forum shopping.'' Much of that criticism is reserved for class action attorneys, who are often accused of scouring the nation for the best states to bring their huge suits in.   For instance, Kansas is known as a good state for suing oil companies over natural gas royalties and Illinois has a reputation for being a smart place to bring product liability class actions.   In an important case decided at the end of its 1984-85 term, the United States Supreme Court gave a go-ahead to forum shopping in the class action context. At the same time, however, it took strong measures to curb some of the more controversial advantages of such practices. Business and the Law;   Class Actions: A Key Ruling"

1982,"  UNITED STATES publishers of Latin American authors are gratified that Gabriel Garcia Marquez of Colombia was recently awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature, for it bolsters their conviction that some of today's most important and innovative writing is being done in the Spanish language. No one was more enthusiastic about the award than John Macrae 3d, publisher of E.P. Dutton & Company. ''I'm delighted that Garcia Marquez won it, because he's a major writer,'' said Mr. Macrae. ''And his winning it represents an important victory for serious writing.''   Dutton has never published Mr. Garcia Marquez, but it is the longtime United States publisher of Jorge Luis Borges of Argentina, Latin America's most prominent man of letters and for years the apparent hemispheric front-runner for the Nobel. Reports from Stockholm early last week said that Mr. Borges, the 83-year-old elder statesman, was again rumored to be in the running, along with Mr.  Garcia Marquez and Mario Vargas Llosa of Peru. PUBLISHING: TRIBUTE TO LATIN AMERICA"
1993,"  About halfway through her concert at the Ritz on Friday night, the Brazilian singer Daniela Mercury let three pre-teen-age samba drummers take over the stage. In folkloric concerts, the arrival of roots-conscious children is precisely the moment when sentimentality drives a stake through the heart of a show: one is expected to bemoan the loss of tradition and applaud the youths' valiant attempts to fight off encroaching international pop culture. But Ms. Mercury had other ideas. The three, beating out a complicated and ferocious samba pattern, were supported by a stadium rock production, including flashing lights, fog banks and a booming sound system. It was a pop spectacle, and it was authentic, and the crowd went haywire.   Ms. Mercury, a young singer from Bahia, packed the Ritz, and it was hard to imagine a better party anywhere. Men were holding women on their shoulders, and the entire audience was swaying to the music, singing along with the songs, or dancing. Ms. Mercury sings with a voice that can move easily from pure pop tones to a hoarse, African style. She and her two dancers worked tightly choreographed routines, and Ms. Mercury pretty much proclaimed herself to be sex on two feet, all in a nicely civilized, consensual adult way. She's a star: but in a domestic touch, her publicity biography mentions that she has two children. Review/Music; Samba Meets Pop and the Crowd Goes Wild"

1991,"  The light dawns slowly. Sometimes it takes weeks or months. Then isolated incidents come together and suddenly a pattern emerges, a pattern with a message: There's a lemon in the closet, an item of clothing that attracts bad vibes almost every time it's worn. How, why and to whom this happens is one of life's mysteries. The only certainty is that it has nothing to do with personality, character or the supernatural.   Not everyone has a bad-luck item in the closet, and even those who do aren't condemned for life. They may have a particular scarf, jacket or shirt that attracts minor calamities, but if and when it's discarded, that's the end of it: The untoward experiences stop. A near-certainty is that the bad vibes aren't contagious. The mischief doesn't spread to other clothes hanging in the wardrobe. New Yorkers, etc."

1966,"""MOMENT TO MOMENT"" is one of those medium-good suspense dramas that should have been something special. If only this Universal release, which opened yesterday in neighborhood theaters, had had Alfred Hitchcock instead of Mervyn LeRoy as director.It has, in any case, a trim little cast, headed by Jean Seberg, Honor Blackman and Arthur Hill. Snugly permeating the film, in becoming color, are the backgrounds of the French Riviera, primarily those tantalizing little hill villages behind Cannes and Nice. Above all, as adapted by John Lee Mahin from a story by Alec Coppel, a good, tingling plot manages to flesh out some persuasive characterizations and convincing human behavior—up to a point. Two points, in fact.Miss Seberg is the decent, attractive wife of a psychiatrist on sabbatical from Columbia University, awaiting his return from a Zurich lecture in their vacation villa at Cannes with their small son. She drifts into a tender affair with a clean-cut American ensign, played by a newcomer, Sean Garrison, that explodes with murderous violence. Why?Here's the second question: Having transported with the aid of her neighbor, Miss Blackman, the body of Mr. Garrison into the woods, why would the otherwise sensible heroine drive back to the the site, poke and pry around and lead the police straight back to the villa? It's hard to forgive her fatal curiosity or stupidity. The rest of the film has the wide-eyed Miss Seberg, who never looked prettier or more appealing, resisting arrest.The picture's real appeal is the final inning, when Arthur Hill, as the returned husband, gamely and innocently helps the cat-and-mouse stalking of his jittery wife by a bland French detective, played with delicious precision by Gregoire Asian. For that matter, Miss Blackman is warmly amusing throughout as the plainspoken, mantrap neighbor who lends Miss Seberg a hand. And there's plenty to be said, with the tourist season approaching, for Harry Stradling's color photography of such off-center Riviera locales as old Mougins, and the new Maeght Art Museum and the Colombe d'Or restaurant-hotel in St. Paul de Vence.If only Mr. Leroy had run a tight wire through his handsome production. Instead, his direction is rather slack and circular, like a standard fishing reel. The bait is all there, but don't expect to be hooked.

1985,"  ARTHRITIS entered Ann DeGrout's life when she was 28. She was walking down the stairs of her home one day when her knees inexplicably gave out. She felt a stinging pain. The symptoms worsened and it became clear that she had rheumatoid arthritis. Thirty years later, the disease is still with her.   Arthritis has been an expensive companion. Mrs. DeGrout, a prim woman with quick eyes who lives in Clifton, N.J., buys about $200 worth of medication a year. She swallows eight to ten tablets a day of Ecotrin, a coated aspirin. Each morning, she takes 5 milligrams of Prednisone, a steroid that must be prescribed by a doctor. At least once a month, she must see her physician, which typically costs her $20 to $50.

1991,"  To the Editor:   ""Increasingly, Prison Term Is the Price for Polluters"" (Law page, Feb. 15) alludes to, but does not really discuss, a troubling aspect of such cases. Federal prosecutors are seeking to remake the law so that the state of mind that must be proved for conviction is altered. Most criminal environmental laws, like most other laws, are broken only if the defendant acted ""knowingly"" or ""intentionally."" Usually that standard is speci fied in the statute. Nevertheless, Federal prosecutors are asking courts to instruct juries that corporate officers may be convicted without the mental state that is applied to all other defendants, but simply if the corporate officer was negligent.   Some prosecutors have even sought to render the officer guilty if any employees below him broke the law, regardless of the officer's lack of fault.   Conviction for negligence (in essence, unreasonableness) has been rare in criminal laws and usually is allowed only for minor regulatory offenses. The idea of sending people to prison for years simply because they failed to meet somebody's view of reasonableness is a radical transformation of American and British jurisprudence.    So too is the idea of courts altering the statutory requirements for conviction at all, let alone doing so for a single class of defendants. The reaction of the courts to this doctrine of the responsible corporate officer has been mixed, but the concept should be strongly opposed by all who believe that legislatures, not courts or prosecutors, should decide what the law provides.

1983,"  There have been better days for the outer boroughs, as residents of Manhattan are fond of calling the rest of the city. Since Mayor Koch settled into City Hall, a modest increase in employment in Staten Island and, to a lesser extent, in Queens have been more than offset by a marked decline in Brooklyn and the Bronx, where factories, shops, banks and restaurants - the economic underpinnings of those boroughs - have closed at a fearsome rate.    So when Mr. Koch decided last week to increase tax breaks for commercial and industrial developers outside of Manhattan, it was tacit recognition that the time had come for the city's central borough to share its wealth. As if to confirm that incentives alone were not enough, Mayor Koch and Governor Cuomo announced agreement on an ambitious plan to rejuvenate a large section of decaying Queens waterfront.

1982,"  Once again, the General Electric Company is going it alone in lobbying Congress on taxes.  It opposes the Administration and most of big business on tax leasing.

In a move that set tongues wagging in Washington tax circles, G.E. recently retained a high-powered lobbyist and political fund-raiser, J.D. Williams.   In all, as Congress searches for ways to raise revenue and shrink future budget deficits, G.E. is living up to its reputation as a special presence in the tax-lobbying arena.

1981,"  Barry Beck of the Rangers will miss the first three games of the National Hockey League season. He was suspended for his part in a fight at Madison Square Friday night.   Beck, the Ranger captain, wrote the following article before the incident. As he says, ''Fighting is part of the pro game, and thus part of my job.'' By BARRY BECK   NOW that a new hockey season is about to begin, it seems like a good time to reflect upon the state of the sport.  Pro hockey continues to be a much-criticized, controversial and often misunderstood sport. It is criticized because many people are offended by the fighting and violence that appear to characterize the game; it is controversial because there is disagreement over whether or how the sport should be changed; and it is misunderstood because the average person has not been presented with a proper education of the game. The result? The great game of hockey is still struggling for a wider acceptance in America. A RANGER LOOKS AT HOCKEY FIGHTS"

1985,"  Is it really so hard to protect Ronald   Reagan - or any future President   - that the Secret Service must close the two blocks of Pennsylvania Avenue that run in front of the White House? And if the threat is that great, will even such an extreme measure prevent some fanatic terrorist from doing his evil work at some other location or in some as-yet undreamed-of fashion?    Fortunately, James A. Baker 3d, who as Secretary of the Treasury oversees the Secret Service, has told Congress that the proposal to seal off the historic avenue is ''still very much in the planning stage.'' So there should be time to stop this latest high- handed scheme of Washington's myriad security zealots.   They don't always get their way. The Reagan Administration, for instance, has just smothered a proposal by its chief cloak-and-dagger man, William J. Casey, the C.I.A. Director. Mr. Casey wanted to include in a C.I.A. authorization bill a provision making it a crime for Government employees to disclose, to anyone not authorized to receive it, classified information that ''reasonably could be expected to damage the national security.''

1991,"  The Jan. 15 deadline for Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait was adopted by the United Nations Security Council as a result of diplomatic compromises and policy considerations.   Administration officials and military commanders say the military rationale behind the Nov. 29 Security Council resolution, which authorized the use of force after Jan. 15, was less important. When Lieut. Gen. Calvin A. H. Waller, the deputy commander of American forces in the Persian Gulf region, said last month that American troops might not be fully ready for combat ""until some time after Feb. 1,"" he was reflecting the views of many of his uniformed colleagues.

''I think that when it's over with, we may have five or 10 things we put in the formula and we may have to sprinkle a lot of salt and pepper on it and just eat it,'' said Representative J.@J.

1982,"  Courtships and other promotional campaigns flourish on the principle that reluctance often yields to a carefully maneuvered increase of temptation. This is the strategy plainly evident in the current offerings of the audio industry. Those glossy new models beckoning from the shelves look as if they were trying hard to be irresistible - each more so than the next.   Central to this seductive effort on part of stereo manufacturers is a frenzied quest for significant innovation, which doesn't always hit the mark. Mere novelty in minor details is more often the result. It is therefore questionable whether the pace of design change typical in this field has any real technical or economic justification, and it is certain that genuine advances are far fewer than superficial alterations. Even so, the majority of newcomers to the ranks of audio equipment are very attractive from any point of view. MORE ABOUT NEW RECEIVERS"

Twenty states have so-called right-to-work laws that forbid labor contracts to require union membership or payment of full union dues as a condition of continued employment. Most or all of these laws also forbid unions to require nonmembers to pay fees for expenses incurred in representing their interests. U.S. COURT BARS UNION FEES FOR SOME NONUNION WORKERS"

The hope in both camps is that the bipartisan National Commission on Social Security Reform, which has begun meeting and will report in the fall, will make recommendations that can be portrayed as representing a national consensus.

1992,"  NEW YORK CITY  BLACKBURNE RESIGNS FROM M.T.A. BOARD   Laura D. Blackburne, who resigned under fire as chairwoman of New York City's Housing Authority on Saturday, has also quit as a member of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority board, where her spending habits had also come under criticism. Ms. Blackburne's lawyer declined to give her client's reasons for leaving the 17-member board she has served since 1985. Her proposed successor has been waiting in the wings for over a year. B3. SCANDALS THAT HIT MAYOR'S SORE POINTS   Any mayor might have been duped by the financial behavior that culminated in a guilty plea by David N. Dinkins's campaign finance chairman two weeks ago and in the resignation under fire of his Housing Authority chairwoman over the weekend. But the scandals transcend the inevitable human failings that torment every administration because they revive two issues from which Mr. Dinkins seems unable to escape: lapses in personal finances and questions of race. News analysis, B3. YES, HE'S BROOKLYN'S MAYOR, TOO   Mayor Dinkins is set to move into his transplanted office at in Brooklyn Borough Hall, in a week-long attempt to get closer to a borough that sometimes feels far from the city's halls of power in Manhattan. It was probably inevitable that the move has presented his aides with some logistical problems -- along with skepticism from the people he hopes to meet. B3. FINDING THE MUNICIPAL NERVE CENTER   With the Dinkins administration moving the ""nerve center"" of city government to Brooklyn this week, the question arises: Where has the nerve center been up to now? Metro Matters, B2. TWO HOUSE PARTIES END IN GUNFIRE   The host at a Brooklyn party turned away a group of teen-age boys after frisking them for guns. The boys retaliated by firing through the door, wounding two girls at the Canarsie apartment. And in Flatbush, a 15-year-old boy was killed and another grazed when gunfire erupted outside a birthday party as 100 young people spilled out on the streets to go home. B2. CARDINAL DENOUNCES RACISM IN CHURCH   Speaking on the last full weekend of Black History Month, John Cardinal O'Connor delivered a homily that amounted to a chastisement of all white Roman Catholics, including himself. He told an almost entirely white congregation at St. Patrick's Cathedral that he was disappointed to see empty pews ""on the one Sunday I'd like to have the greatest attendance,"" and then delivered a bitter message about racism among churchgoers, black and white. B3.    Rocks are thrown at bus carrying yeshiva students in Brooklyn. B2. REGION  GOVERNING THE PINELANDS   A 10-year policy agenda for governing the million-acre preserve drawn up by the New Jersey Pinelands Commission includes enough nods toward the concerns of builders, farmers and quarry operators to worry some environmentalists that profits may win out over preservation in the state's premiere nature reserve. It is the first full-scale review of the Pinelands' plan since rules to limit development and regulate industry in the preserve were adopted in 1981. B5. D'AMATO SEEKS TO PAY LEGAL BILLS   Sen. Alfonse M. D'Amato plans to begin a fund-raising drive to pay off more than $400,000 in legal bills for his defense in the Senate on charges of ethical misconduct. He said he cannot afford the bill himself, and cannot spare his regular campaign money because he faces a tough fight for re-election. ""I can't afford to personally pay it, so I have to depend on the generosity of others,"" he said. The Senator has already sold more than 200 tickets to a $1,000-a-plate fund-raiser tonight in New York City. B5. NO COMMUTER TRAIN IS A MODEL TRAIN   There were no tiny commuter cars at the 18th Annual Spring Train Meet in Old Greenwich (51 mintutes by express from Grand Central, 59 on the local). People there already spend enough time on the way to and from work.

1994,"  JUST OFF Mott Street, in the heart of Chinatown, clinging to the bustling Hop-Kee restaurant, there is Cecilia Tam's Hong Kong Egg Cake Company, a humble, unobtrusive red shack that most of the time eludes the attention of tourists. There are no fancy signs or display shelves. Just an aluminum tray, three stove-top burners and a tiny woman working furiously to churn out golden nuggets the size of melon balls from a concoction that looks like pancake batter.    But on lunch breaks and weekends, the stall is often a street scene unto itself. A line forms by the shack on Mosco Street and sometimes wraps around the corner onto Mott. Mrs. Tam has gained a following that is the envy of the other cake stalls that have sprung up in Chinatown during the last three years. Customers say they would rather wait in the rain or cold than go elsewhere. The Egg-Cake Lady of Mosco Street"

In a series of free weekend concerts throughout July and August, Joel Sachs, the festival's artistic director, will focus on music from the first 30 years of the century; an all-American opening concert on Friday night presented works of Ruggles, Cowell, Copland and Ives.   Mr. Sachs, who is also a co-director of the Continuum ensemble and mastermind of Juilliard's ""Focus"" festivals, has tended to choose innovators rather than conservative voices; in the listings one sees Leo Ornstein, Alexander Mossolov and George Antheil alongside the expected Schoenberg, Stravinsky and Bartok.

1984,"   After months of plotting and prepping, it is time to run the 110th Kentucky Derby Saturday, but few handlers are confident about their horses and few handicappers have strong opinions about the race.   This is a Derby in which the favorite, Althea, is a filly who will break from a poor post, and the second choice in the early line, Swale, is coming up to the race on two discouragingly slow workouts. Taylor's Special, the third choice, has a pedigree that says he will quit before finishing the mile and a quarter, and Vanlandingham, the fourth choice, has not been to the races for five weeks.   What is missing from the Derby, which will be nationally telecast by ABC at 5:38 P.M., are the glamour colts of the winter who had figured to make this a private contest.

But does any President have the right to promise American arms to a foreign state?  We leave aside the propriety of pledging $8.5 billion of the most advanced, sophisticated and highly classified weapons in the American arsenal to a regime that will not permit American troops on its soil, that gives millions of dollars per year to the terrorist P.L.O., that denounced the Camp David accords - the basis of U.S.  Middle East policy - that broke diplomatic relations with Egypt, and denounced President Sadat for signing a peace treaty with ''hated'' Israel.

They have surfaced during an artistic moment just as soaked in ''primitivism,'' as the early 20th century and one even more charged by conflicting currents of extreme rawness and extreme self- consciousness.     In short, ''Modern Masks'' outlines a main chapter in a big story. Susan Lubowsky, director of the Whitney branch museum, has assembled around 60 works, all of them sculptures; a comprehensive treatment of the subject would also consider the barrage of masks and masklike images in contemporary painting. Young artists like Rodney Alan Greenblat are placed alongside established figures like Saul Steinberg. Partly because of what may be an inherent ambiguity within the subject, the show is disquieting. On the one hand, a mask disguises and protects the self. On the other hand, it can either liberate or even become the self: In William Golding's ''Lord of the Flies,'' the more the children on the desert island paint themselves like warriors, the more they became what they are.

1993,"  Ultimately, Jeff Torborg was done in by Pat Riley's hair. Not by an outfielder's insecurity or a general manager's ineptitude or the media's ravenous appetite, although he took the rap for all that, too. Torborg was fired because the competition in New Jock City has become an interdisciplinary battle royal and Torborg was compared with a man who is perceived to have given the Knicks collective character, to have squeezed a handful of loose change into a golden coin.   So why couldn't Torborg have done the same thing, ask the querulous voices of think-tank radio? Why couldn't Torborg, with basically better material than Riley -- at least on paper -- teach, motivate, boot, abuse, do whatever was necessary to make those overripe adolescents earn their amazing salaries? Those are good questions in New Jock City, now that cross-sports comparisons are mandatory for fandom. With the exception of Patrick Ewing, there are no certified superstars on the Knicks, and even Ewing is not the standard at his position. So if the Knicks beat Chicago, the key will be Coach Riley. Meanwhile, the Mets have Doc Gooden, Bobby Bonilla, Eddie Murray, Howard Johnson, Tony Fernandez, and if they can't even beat Chicago, the key must be Manager Torborg.

Alfred Poe, a former vice president of marketing for M&M/Mars in Hackettstown, was an original investor in Testamints five years ago and then became its chief executive.

There was no early sign that Mr. Salem had made any headway, and the statecontrolled radio continued to denounce the Israeli-Lebanese accord worked out last week by Secretary of State George P. Shultz.   (In Beirut, the Cabinet held a three-hour meeting without giving its formal endorsement to the Israeli-Lebanese agreement, but the approval is expected later.

In his news conference, Mr. Reagan asserted that the sanctions announced last month ''have had an effect, although there's no question that the situation in Poland is deteriorating.''   The Polish authorities have in the last 10 days taken some steps toward restoring normality, lifting censorship on foreign journalists, restoring local phone service and permitting internal travel. Mr. Reagan said, however, that while those were presented as ''moderating,'' there was not any real change.   ''The people are still imprisoned,'' he said.

Some children resisted for minutes, even hours, growing steadily more frightened and angry.    These days, experts on children and food would tell those parents to cut it out. There is a new orthodoxy in the land: Adults are supposed to provide a variety of healthy, appealing foods for children -- but they aren't supposed to force the children to eat anything. Food is not to be used as a weapon, or a reward. Children are supposed to choose what, and how much, they eat. For More Parents, Sweets Point the Way to a Balanced Diet"

And today he will be playing against Dick Stockton in the quarterfinals, with many people not quite sure whether they want him to win or lose. If he wins, he might embarrass tennis again.

The statue switch is one of many changes that have come to this city, once the showcase of Portuguese Africa. In early 1976, the Marxist Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola extended its control to Huambo, largely sealing off Angola's second-largest city to Western reporters for a decade.    The Portuguese had proudly called this city in Angola's central highlands Nova Lisboa - New Lisbon.

2006,"ABOUT a year ago, the New York State Legislature made a number of revisions to the Rockefeller drug laws. The most significant changes involved reducing sentences for nonviolent drug offenders, raising the amount of drugs required for top-level possession charges and allowing defendants serving a life term to apply for a reduced sentence. The primary goal was to grant low-level drug dealers relief from overly harsh sentences.      These measures were a step in the right direction, but unfortunately they fail to take into account drug kingpins. As the new legislative session begins this month, the priority should be to retain severe sentencing for major drug dealers while providing more alternatives to incarceration and more treatment options for low-level addicts and small-time dealers.   Reform the Reforms"

1983,"  FOR five years, the Exxon Corporation has been making it possible for the Guggenheim Museum to send people out into the field to tell us what goes on, both in this country and in other parts of the world. This year's findings are disclosed in an exhibition called ''New Perspectives in American Art: The 1983 Exxon National Exhibition,'' which has just opened at the museum. It was organized by Diane Waldman, deputy director of the Guggenheim, who traveled throughout the United States in hopes of coming back with something good.   Eleven artists were chosen. In view of the museum's track record in such matters, it is doubtless a change for the better that three of them are women. The space allocated to the artists is generous, and Exxon has provided funds to buy one work by each of them. They come from all over - Texas, California, New Mexico, South Dakota, New York - and most were born between 1947 and 1955. VISITORS FROM THE PAST"

1985,"  THE scene was fitting: the Columbia University campus, where some of the angriest   student protests of the 60's and 70's were waged. And if the fervor seemed fresh, the cause   had stirred colleges, legislatures and, occasionally, boardrooms, for years - what to do about South Africa. Columbia, which decided in 1978 to sell investments in companies ''which show indifference. . .to the prevailing repressive racial policies in South Africa,'' still has nearly $33 million worth of stock in 26 companies doing business there, and more than 100 students and a smattering of faculty and staff members barricaded themselves in front of Hamilton Hall to demand that the holdings be sold. The school got a court order forbidding the demonstration, but lawyers for the protesters persuaded another judge to prohibit the university from calling in the police. Meanwhile, seven students ended a hunger strike after Dr. Michael I. Sovern, the Columbia president, agreed to convey their concern to a panel of trustees studying the question. A long list of universities, including Harvard, Yale, Antioch and Michigan State, have either fully or selectively ''disinvested'' in companies linked with South Africa. So have many jurisdictions, among them Philadelphia, the District of Columbia, Boston, New York City and State, Connecticut, Nebraska, Maryland and Massachusetts. But others say disinvestment - especially blanket disinvestment - is at best an ineffective weapon against apartheid and at worst is counterproductive. Richard Levine of The Week in Review discussed the issue last week with Roy Schotland, a professor at the Georgetown University Law Center, and Randall Robinson, executive director of Transafrica, the group that has been organizing demonstrations in front of the South African Embassy in Washington.

In the past, he has seemed like an ambitious artist with an apparently limitless supply of ideas, but not enough good ones. In fact, the chief interest in his exhibitions often lies in the sheer variety of materials and forms: a half-dozen of his large sculptures seen together look like the products of as many different hands. Unfortunately, the biomorphic mode he has often favored in recent years has yielded few rewards. It seems at once leaden and precious, especially when infused with heavy-handed ecological subtexts.

Some critics have attacked those policies as having starved the universities' foreign language and international studies and research as well as foreign exchange programs.   As an example of the Administration's apparent change of heart, it recently asked for a $20.3 million increase for Fulbright fellowships and other programs involving the exchange of students and scholars between the United States and other countries. In addition, the Administration asked for $24.6 million to let undergraduates from Central America study on American campuses. CHANGE OF HEART IS NEEDED ON FOREIGN STUDIES"

As it happens, the new Cat in the Hat Balloon in this year's Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade is sponsored by Random House in association with TNT and Esprit clothing.    All of which carries more than a whiff of paradox regarding a writer whose most famous tale, ""How the Grinch Stole Christmas,"" ended with the astute realization: ""Maybe Christmas doesn't come from a store. Maybe Christmas perhaps means a little bit more."" But then Dr. Seuss himself, really Theodor (Ted) S.

Or at least the way they were depicted in novels, movies and memoirs. As Janet Flanner put it, ""Paris was yesterday.""   I must admit that when I arrived in Paris 25 years ago as a Fulbright Fellow I was so busy searching for the ghosts of Hemingway and Fitzgerald, so obsessed with scenes that appeared to spring full blown from Truffaut films, I was in danger of tripping over my own feet. But on a recent return it began to register on me that the city no longer corresponds to my callow recollections. I think it was the rabbits that shocked me into recognition. Landing at Charles de Gaulle Airport after an all-night flight, I gazed groggily out the window and noticed that the grassy patches beside the runway were aswarm with rabbits. Suddenly, like Alice falling through the looking glass, I tumbled into an altogether new place and realized that Paris is today. Today's Paris Doesn't Look Back"

At first claimed by Virginia and later by North Carolina, Tennessee had its first great pioneer in Daniel Boone, who traversed the region in the 1760's. Political attitudes in the 18th century were shaped by the land, with the cotton and tobacco growers in the fertile western part of the state favoring slavery and the backwoods people of the eastern hills opposed to it. The Cherokees were removed to Oklahoma by the federal government in the 1830's. The state was captured by Union troops in 1862 and put under the governorship of Andrew Johnson, later a U.S. president. Its economy was radically altered in the 1930's and 1940's by the creation of the Tennessee Valley Authority, which provided abundant energy for industry, and to a lesser extent by the location of the government's first uranium enrichment facility at Oak Ridge during World War II. The state's leading industries are textiles, food processing, and chemicals, and there is considerable lead and coal mining in the east. For Tenase, principal village of Cherokees.

1985,"  THE JOCKEY CLUB, A SOCIETY OF 91 thoroughbred owners whose roster is littered with Bancrofts, Phippses and Vanderbilts, has an image corresponding to its Madison Avenue location. To outsiders, its name and address conjure a picture of overstuffed millionaires in overstuffed leather club chairs, sipping sherry as they vote to exclude horses and owners of weak pedigree from the so-called Sport of Kings.   If that were true, the admission of three women in November 1983 might have been accompanied by the wailing and resignations prompted by the integration of similarly traditional institutions, like the Downtown Athletic Club or the Harvard Club. In fact, though, the Jockey Club shares less in purpose or attitude with such clubs than it does with the Department of Motor Vehicles.    The Jockey Club's roster may read like the Social Register, but the function of its almost solely honorary membership is the tedious bookkeeping of the parentage, ownership and blood types of hundreds of thousands of race horses.

The other diaries cover the years 1935-1954 and 1964-1965. The German- born Remarque migrated to the United States in 1939 and in the 1940's and 50's lived in Hollywood, where he wrote many novels and screenplays. The diaries include character sketches that the author later developed in his fiction. REMARQUE'S DIARIES GIVEN TO N.Y.U."
1986,"  What is America's policy toward terror, Iran and Syria? At the moment, the landscape is littered with contradictions.   On the one hand: The sale of American arms to Iran is strictly forbidden.

1982,"  SERIOUS artistic films have been attracting expanded audiences in the county the last few years, with individuals and groups sponsoring film series and workshops that feature foreign and noncommercial films that would otherwise not be seen here.   Capitalizing on what appears to be a preference among many county residents to seek entertainment closer to home, such organizations as the Chappaqua Film Society and the Westchester Cinema Club have successfully replicated the specialized film experiences long offered in Manhattan.   The latest and perhaps most ambitious effort to bring serious, noncommercial films to audiences in the county is the founding of The Film Center at Westchester Community College in Valhalla.   On the premise that thoughtful viewers recognize that enjoyment is enhanced by an increased awareness of a film's artistic qualities, the college has added three new evening and weekend film courses for the fall semester - designed more to attract a countywide audience than undergraduates. In addition, the center will begin a 10-week Friday Night Film Series, using the new 400-seat theater in the Academic Arts Building. The college will continue to offer two daytime undergraduate film courses. GROWING AUDIENCE SUPPORTS NONCOMMERCIAL FILM SERIES"

1991,"  Hurricane Bob was much easier to track than the storm over Moscow. Viewers awakened yesterday to the news that President Mikhail S. Gorbachev had been displaced by some sort of emergency committee. And then came the pictures, so much like others that have filled screens since 1989, of civilians confronting or consorting with soldiers. Only this time, they were smack in Moscow.   Demonstrators climbed onto the tanks that had been ordered into Moscow. There was a little jostling and an apparently testy exchange or two, but mostly the soldiers seemed relaxed, even friendly. Hands were shaken, cigarettes shared. Steve Hurst, the CNN man in Moscow, told of hearing a woman say to one of the tankmen, ""Think about what you are doing."" Some soldiers showed that their guns were not loaded. But the tension persisted. Boris N. Yeltsin, the President of the Russian Republic and the country's most persistent reformer, was seen addressing a crowd from what looked like the top of a tank.

1986,"  IT'S pretty major, and very nice news. Mary Tyler Moore and Lynn Redgrave will be returning to Broadway as of Dec. 19. Miss Moore was last here in 1980 in ''Whose Life Is It, Anyway?'' and Miss Redgrave appeared in ''Aren't We All?'' last year. But what makes the project even more interesting is that the play in which they'll be co-starring, ''Sweet Sue,'' by A. R. Gurney Jr., has a format that is, to say the least, unusual. Miss Moore and Miss Redgrave will both play the title role, and if you think that's confusing, there will also be two actors, as yet uncast, playing the same male character. In other words, instead of a few actors taking on multiple roles, a not uncommon occurrence, this one will have four actors playing two characters.   How it's going to be done is too complicated to relate, and will have to be seen (which is, of course, the object of the production) but Mr. Gurney describes it as ''asking the audience to look at the story from two different perspectives - somewhat like a Picasso painting where you see both a profile and a face head on.''

1995,"  In the past several years, police officers have been investigated for illegal acitivies including brutality, drug dealing and theft. Here is a summary of the major cases and the officers who have been charged. 30TH PRECINCT, HARLEM   In August 1993 several Harlem police officers were videotaped breaking into an apartment that had been set up by undercover officers as a phony drug den. The sting operation, which followed reports that officers had been shaking down drug dealers and stealing property on their beats opened up one of the city's biggest police corruption scandals in decades. In the days and months that followed, more than two dozen other officers and supervisors were arrested. The most recent arrests came last week, when two officers and a sergeant were accused of falsifying arrest records and lying in court to win convictions.

Thus began the Morgue Boy's investigation. In a trial that ended on Tuesday, jurors acquitted three officers of extortion charges but deadlocked on civil rights charges stemming from what prosecutors said were illegal searches and arrests based on false evidence.   Christopher Banke -- obstruction of justice -- pleaded guilty, sentence pending   Philip Carlucci -- conspiracy -- pleaded guilty, sentence pending   Kevin Hembury -- conspiracy -- pleaded guilty, sentence pending   Keith Goodman -- extortion, conspiracy -- acquitted   civil rights violations -- mistrial   Frank Mistretta -- extortion, conspiracy -- acquitted   civil rights violations -- mistrial   Richard Sanfilippo -- extortion, conspiracy -- acquitted   civil rights violations -- mistrial 109TH PRECINT, QUEENS   Early last year the Police Department received a series of complaints form residents in and around Flushing that several officers were using drugs on the job. Four officers were ordered to take drug tests: one resigned and the other three failed their tests and were dismissed. The department also set up a series of corruption stings, resulting in the arrests of two officers and one former officer, who are accused of stealing $1,400 while responding to a false report of a kidnapping. Police officials say more officers are under investigation.    Anthony Biancaniello -- grand larceny -- case pending   Joseph DiGregorio -- grand larceny -- case pending   John Pylyp -- grand larceny -- case pending   48TH PRECINCT, THE BRONX   The 48th Precinct is the latest focus of corruption inquiries, with two dozen officers currently under investigation, police officials say. After sting operations involving undercover officers posing as drug dealers, eight officers from the 48th have been placed on desk duty, and officials say that indictments of more than a dozen more could come as early as this week. One of the officers on desk duty, Timothy Zaccardo, has also been charged by the Rockland County District Attorney with participating in a suburban cocaine ring. Officers from the 48th are believed to have robbed drug dealers, sold narcotics and beat up suspects. Pockets of Corruption"

1985,"  QUESTION: Was Alvin Crowder, the former Washington Senators' pitcher, ever elected to the Hall of Fame? What were his best seasons in the majors and did he ever win a World Series game?   Alvin Floyd Crowder, also called General Crowder, is not a member of the Hall of Fame, although his pitching from 1926-36 was substantial enough to earn him some consideration. During those 11 seasons, the right-handed Crowder won 167 times and lost 115 times with a 4.12 earned-run average in 403 games with three American League teams - the Senators, the St. Louis Browns and the Detroit Tigers. Fifteen of those victories came for the Senators without losing during the 1932 season, one short of the American League record for victories in succession. Crowder, who came up with the Senators, was traded to the Browns on July 7, 1927 for Tom Zachry, the pitcher who on the last day of that season gave up Babe Ruth's 60th home run. In 1928 with the Browns, Crowder led the league with a 21-5 record, an .808 percentage. A year and a half later, on June 13, 1930, he was sent back to Washington, along with Heinie Manush, in a trade for Goose Goslin. In 1932, he led the league with a 26-13 record for the Senators and in 1933, his 24-15 record helped Washington win the pennant. Crowder also helped the Tigers win pennants in 1934 and 1935, after they acquired him on waivers Aug. 8, 1934. QUESTION BOX"

1994,"  The Rules On Renting Co-op Units Q A year and a half ago I sublet the co-op I own in New York City after the board approved a one-year lease. The board limited the term of the lease to a year. At the time of the sublet the co-op's bylaws allowed a unit to be sublet for up to four years before the shareholder had to move back in or sell it. When the tenant rented my unit it was with the understanding that the four-year clause was in effect even though the lease was for only one year. The intent on both our parts was to sign a new lease for each of the four years. This year, part way into the second one-year lease, the co-op board changed the sublet period to a maximum of two years, after which I must either move back in or sell. Do I have the legal right to sublet my apartment in years three and four, either by grandfathering in the four-year sublet clause, which was in place at the time the lease was first signed, or by any other means? . . .

1986,"  ''Just Between Friends,'' Mary Tyler Moore's latest starring vehicle, is full of things to put one off it. Most prominent among these is Holly Davis (Miss   Moore), who's officially described in the film's press kit as ''comfortable, conservative, shy . . . a career housewife,'' who lives in Southern California sitcom land with two uncharacterized teen-age children and a husband who's only characterized by his job - he's a seismologist.   There's nothing really wrong with Miss Moore's performance as Holly, though it's not particularly convincing or appealing. By whatever name the character is called, and no matter what she has to say, we still recognize her as our old television friend, Mary Richards, which isn't bad. Rather, the problem with the film is in the way that the screenplay requires her to behave. MARY TYLER MOORE: A SITCOM PRISONER"

1982,"  Officials in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut believe President Reagan's ''new federalism'' proposals hold potentially devastating consequences for their states and for New York City, even though the Reagan Administration insists that there would be no winners or losers.   According to Brad T. Johnson, the director of the New York State office in Washington, even if the arithmetic shows that a state would gain by the President's plan for the Federal Government to assume Medicaid costs in return for the states taking over the food-stamp program and Aid to Families with Dependent Children, the gain would be subtracted from each state's share of the $28 billion trust fund proposed by Mr. Reagan.   The trust fund is designed to provide the states with money to help pay for a total of 43 programs - such as urban mass transit and urban development -that the states would assume, starting in 1984.  According to the White House, the fund would be divided between the states according to their share from the Federal Government in the fiscal years 1979 to 1981, less whatever financial gain a state had made on the Medicaid exchange.

1994,"  It is more than a year now since Hemmings Motor News, a monthly magazine the size of a big-city phone book and every bit as eye-catching, supplanted The World of Interiors as my bath-time reading. There are no articles in H.M.N., only wall-to-wall classified ads for cars all over the country. There are very few pictures, most of them tiny grainy black-and-white snapshots submitted by eager owners to whet the interest of potential buyers. The cover is brown paper. But the reader's imagination picks up where the magazine leaves off. While before I would lie in a tubful of suds and ponder all the ways in which life might be different if I had a tortoise-shell bathroom, now I wonder how the world would look from behind the wheel of a peppy little Mercedes SL with the top down.    I drive a four-door sedan. I was raised to believe that four-door sedans were a sign of character. Solid, sensible, sturdy, practical, they performed their duties in a straightforward fashion, without striving for sex appeal or charisma. My aunt has always been of a different opinion. When not too long ago she went to pick up her new car -- a 1992 Mercury Capri, her seventh convertible -- the dealer handed her a dozen red roses and asked her to pose for a commemorative picture in front of it. He evidently found it amusing that a woman on the far side of 70 would be buying a convertible. My mother and I found it amusing that he found it amusing. We would have been surprised if after all these years she'd suddenly opted for anything else. We had, in fact, come to think of my aunt as the convertible type -- not frivolous but fun, invested in the moment. Auto Biography"

1986,"  The 1986 Congressional elections, an embarrassing episode in our recent history, are likely to produce about what they deserve, which is very little. Though these contests were supposed to determine ''control of the Senate,'' the chances are that the margin of victory will be so slim that neither party will be able to control anything but its temper, and maybe not even that.   Yet, after winning four out of the last five Presidential elections, and after almost six years of the Reagan Presidency, the outlook for a Republican domination of American politics now seems less bright than it did in l980 or l984.   This does not mean that President Reagan will be unable to define the issues for decision against a divided and leaderless Democratic Party in the next two years. It means merely that all the predictions of a Reagan Revolution leading to a fundamental and lasting shift of the balance of power in favor of the Republicans have been at least premature.

1982,"HERBERT ROWBARGE By Natalie Babbitt.  216 pp. New York: Farrar, Straus & Giroux.  $11.95. (Ages 14 and Up)

SOMEONE ought to start spreading the word that Natalie Babbitt is not only a children's writer. Granted, her books have the firmly defined story line that children love - as anyone knows who's watched a youngster sit mesmerized by ''Knee-Knock Rise'' or ''The Eyes of the Amaryllis.'' They're certainly plotted in a way that will lure the most phlegmatic young reader. But the style is so fine and subtle that grownups too will take real pleasure. ''Tuck Everlasting,'' for instance, is one of the best books ever written - for any age. You can picture a child rereading it every year or so, on into adulthood, and appreciating it at a deeper level each time. CHILDREN'S BOOKS;

1983,"  A Fine Winter Cheese    Before cheese making became industrialized and refrigeration was commonplace, many cheeses that we now take for granted all year were strictly seasonal; Camembert and Brie de Meaux, for example, were in season only from November to May. A cheese that is still available only in winter is vacherin or vacherin Mont d'Or, one of the most delectable of the soft-ripening varieties.   Vacherin is distinctive in several respects. The perimeter of the flat wheel, small or large, is traditionally wrapped in a strip of evergreen bark, giving the mellow, honeyed, delicately pungent flavor a slightly resinous complexity. The crust, a deep orangey beige, begins to bubble and ripple when the cheese is ripe and the interior is runny and satiny, so that the cheese is often eaten with a spoon. It is complemented equally well by a mature red wine such as Burgundy or a sweet white such as Sauternes. FOOD NOTES"

1986,"  The Supreme Court decision on Monday invalidating Federal regulations designed to require life-prolonging medical treatment for severely handicapped infants is seen as a major ruling, but only one step in the long and painful development of new policies to govern society in the face of rapidly advancing medical capabilities.   The issue of withdrawing or withholding life-sustaining medical treatment from severely handicapped babies is an emotional one that mixes three themes held sacred in American society: the right to privacy, the right to life and the right of governments to protect the defenseless from abuses. In an age of medical marvels, the basic question is: Must we always do all that we can do? And how does society protect against abuses?   The High Court, in its first foray into this profound moral controversy, chose a legalistic path. It ruled that there was no evidence that hospitals had discriminated against handicapped infants or had refused treatment sought by parents. Thus, it said, there was no reason for Federal intervention in a sensitive area ordinarily left to state agencies. BABY DOE DECISION: A TENTATIVE FIRST STEP ON A PROFOUND ISSUE"

In his first appearance in New York since an arbitrator ruled almost three months ago that his lifetime suspension from baseball for pleading guilty to a Federal drug charge should be rescinded, Howe looked fit and happy. He also appeared capable of throwing his blazing fastball by tomorrow, which had to hearten the Yankees, who will need him if they are to challenge in the American League East this season. Void in Bullpen    After Howe was indefinitely suspended from baseball for a seventh time last June, the Yankees crumbled. Without Howe, who was 3-0 with 6 saves and a 2.45 earned run average, Manager Buck Showalter did not have a reliable left-hander. The Yankees lost 59 of the 107 games the reliever missed.

1995,"  Haim Steinbach  Jay Gorney Modern Art 100 Greene Street (between Prince and Spring Streets) SoHo Through March 18    It's often remarked that while narrative has pretty much vanished from modern art, what's replaced it is art history itself. The ""content"" of abstract or Conceptual art often lies in its stylistic references to earlier art. Haim Steinbach's latest show simplifies the task of interpretation by providing the relevant art-historical references. There are a dozen series of photographs by Eadweard Muybridge, the 19th-century pioneer of stop-action photography, and two photomontages by Michael Snow, the film maker and Conceptual artist who came to prominence in the 1960's. The Muybridges here record the execution of mundane actions: a man climbing up a ladder, or getting up from a couch. Similarly, one collage by Mr. Snow captures the movements of random passers-by in the subway. Art in Review"

These urbanites' language may be sharper and their games more refined, but their emotions are just as raw. This movie, directed by the actor Fisher Stevens from a screenplay by Patrick Breen, crisscrosses the romantic lives of a gallery of sharply drawn New York caricatures whose tit-for-tat bed hopping eventually lands three of them in the hospital. What elevates the movie above the run-of-the-mill singles blender is its surreal sense of humor and technological finish. Before it ends, the movie allows its characters to go back in time and make different, less destructive choices. &#151; Stephen Holden 'Just a Kiss'"

The work's Orientalisms, its microtonal swirls, its stomping dancing and swerving lines were, of course, expertly articulated. Mr. Stern's familiar virtuosity did not fail him, though he played from the score. Together with the pianist Andrew Wolf, Mr. Stern gave the music's repeated gestures a passionate pointedness.   Such native familiarity was in evidence throughout Mr. Stern's annual Carnegie Hall recital - propriety and respect for style. What made the Enesco work so potent was the sense that something had fallen away from the player during the music - a mask, if you will, or a role. MUSIC: ISAAC STERN PLAYS ENESCO AT CARNEGIE HALL"
1986,"  SMART and funny writers don't automatically write smart and funny plays. In ''The Nice and the Nasty,'' his new comedy at Playwrights Horizons, the talented Mark O'Donnell unleashes an almost nonstop barrage of erudite barbs - all aimed at such unassailable contemporary nemeses as greed, pollution and apocalyptic warfare. The play has a considered style as well: it's written in knowing absurdist parody of Hollywood kitsch, complete with a set (by Loren Sherman) that could be the glassy corporate Manhattan of the Doris Day-Rock Hudson comedies in midnuclear meltdown. But ''The Nice and the Nasty'' has two deficiencies that all the sophistication, cleverness and social conscience in the world cannot remedy - it isn't funny enough, and it isn't theater.

1982,"  Interest rates should decline this spring, many analysts say, but they readily add that the trend to lower rates may not extend into the second half of the year when the economy's recovery is expected to increase credit demand from business and consumers.   The flexibility of interest rate forecasters and their willingness to describe in the same publication reasons that rates might rise or fall is not suprising, given the extreme uncertainty about the future course of the economy, money supply, inflation and the pattern of business credit demand.   Interest rates have never been so high for so long, and many analysts expect high rates to result in a weaker-than-normal economic recovery this year. Even if short-term rates remain below the record levels of 1980-81, they are high in comparison with inflation and keep a damper on the housing and automobile industries. RATE DROP THIS SPRING SEEN"

1993,"  Players who lead a trump usually do so either because they hope to cut down ruffing chances in the dummy or because other leads look risky. But occasionally they find that they have hit the the bull's-eye for a totally unexpected reason. A case in point is the diagramed deal from a social game, reported by Jack Mahoney of Jersey City. He held the South hand, and climbed to six diamonds after a takeout double by West had marked him with all the missing high-card strength.   West led a trump thinking that it would do no harm, and this proved highly irritating to the declarer: His apparent 12 tricks had shrunk to 11 because the crucial trump entry to the dummy had been removed before the spades could be unblocked, but he now had an opportunity for brilliant play.

1983,"  No new investment instruments have attracted so many investors in so short a time as stock-index futures and options. Nor have so many market analysts, brokers, professional and ordinary investors struggled so hard to understand their use.   The flow of the new instruments has continued unabated since the Kansas City Board of Trade opened its market in Value Line index futures in February 1982. There are now markets in futures on stock indexes, subindexes, options on index futures and options based on no underlying futures - and more are on the way.   Essentially, an index option gives an investor the right - but not the obligation - to buy or sell a specific value of a stock market index on a specific date. An index future is an obligation to buy or sell a theoretical market basket of stock - as represented by the index - at some specified date and price. HEAVY PLAY IN MARKET INDEXES"

It's still hard to beat Disney's technical wizards for adroit surprises. To name one: ""Parade of the Pink Elephants"" in the enchanting, animated ""Dumbo"" (1941). This brilliantly clever dream sequence is the pivot of the plot, after the circus's baby elephant sips some champagne. Even if you don't see the whole picture, tune in toward the end -- Friday at 6 P.M. on Disney.    A live-action treat, via Marguerite Henry's book for children, is James B Clark's ""Misty"" (1961), about a brother and sister drawn to a wild horse. Set on Chincoteague Island, off the Virginia coast, the trenchantly scenic yarn has an appealing human element in young David Ladd and Pam Smith (in picture), and Arthur O'Connell and Anne Seymour as their parents -- Thursday at noon on Disney.    For a brisk, flavorsome adventure mixing castaways and prehistoric animals, to stunning music (Bernard Herrmann, who else?) -- with a humorous edge -- try Cy Endfeld's ""Mysterious Island"" (1961). Gary Merrill, Joan Greenwood, Michael Craig, Michael Callan and Herbert Lom pitch in. A sporting team, no lulls -- Tuesday at 12:30 P.M. on Cinemax.    The same goes for a sassy, contagious grin of a movie: Ossie Davis's ""Cotton Comes to Harlem"" (1970). Derived from a Chester Himes story, this sly caper centers on a con scheme that tilts a neighborhood. The marvelously limber cast includes Raymond St. Jacques, Godfrey Cambridge, Calvin Lockhart, Redd Foxx and Judy Pace. Hold tight -- Saturday at 8 P.M. on TNT. Howard Thompson MOVIES THIS WEEK"

1986,"  THE day before the 1980 National Football League college draft, Rulon Jones heard a rumor that didn't exactly thrill him: The Cleveland Browns intended to take him on the first round. ''Nothing against Cleveland,'' he said the other day. ''But that wasn't too exciting.''   It wasn't the Browns that soured him. It was living in the city. Any city. He never had before and didn't want to then. When the rumor failed to materialized, and the Denver Broncos took him on the second round, he couldn't have been happier. ''The perfect situation for me,'' he said. And for most of this season, Jones has been the perfect defensive end for the Broncos. Through 11 weeks of play, he leads the American Conference with 13 1/2 sacks, a club record. Only Lawrence Taylor of the Giants, whom the Broncos play today in Giants Stadium, has more: 16 1/2.

One of the first American enterprises into the Soviet Union was MCA, which helped market a new Soviet label called Art and Electronics.

1993,"  To the Editor:   ""Clinton Among the Swells"" (editorial, Aug. 22) is an unfortunate misrepresentation of Martha's Vineyard, as well as a mindless and snide attack on President Clinton.   The Vineyard is not only celebrities. The real island population consists of fishers, farmers, tradespeople and professionals, with large numbers of seasonal visitors, who come to enjoy its natural beauty and solitude.    The character of the Vineyard can be measured by a glance at the twice-weekly Vineyard Gazette, which emphasizes the environment, human interest stories of ordinary local folks, outstanding photography and local business and political news. Celebrities appear in print on occasions when they have volunteered themselves for a local cause. Why Chide Clinton or the Vineyard for His Vacationing There?"

He was seventy-two, and lived in Charlottesville, VA. Mr. Forrest's first novel, ''Who Killed Mr. Garland's Mistress,'' was nominated for The Edgar Award. He published over two dozen novels, eight of which, formed The Lyon and Bea Wentworth Mystery Series.

To show what kind of painting was taught in these academies and to shed light on 19th-century attitudes toward women's education, the Connecticut Historical Society in Hartford has mounted a small but appealing exhibition entitled ''Accomplished Young Lady: Watercolors by Connecticut Schoolgirls, 1800-1835.''

The show, which opened this month and will continue until Oct. 8, presents 14 works executed by students enrolled at such prestigious institutions as Miss Draper's Seminary and the Patten School, in Hartford, and the Litchfield Female Academy. These schools combined conventional academic subjects like reading, writing, grammar, mathematics, geography, history, science and philosophy with courses designed ''for women'' - needlework, music, French and painting.

1993,"  COOKING programs are the soap operas of the 90's, in which poaching supplants passion. Since the mid-1960's, when Julia Child warbled her way to America's hearts and the Galloping Gourmet demonstrated that clowning and cooking did indeed mix, these broadcasts have steadily grown in popularity. On any weekend, dozens of cooking shows saturate the airwaves, showing everything from Amish cuisine to Zen vegetarianism.   The rewards are significant for those involved in the most popular shows. Today's whisk-waving television heavyweight is Jeff Smith, whose program, ""The Frugal Gourmet,"" has been among the top five programs on PBS for five years. Aside from the money ""The Frugal Gourmet"" earns from commercial sponsors, Mr. Smith's books related to the show have sold in the millions. And cooking programs have a long life, as they are bought and sold by cable-television companies that keep them in reruns for years, and as they resurface for sale on videotape.   Moreover, industry spokesmen say their growth is certain to continue. In November, the new Television Food Network will debut, featuring eight hours a day of food-related programming, including cooking shows. In New York City this fall, WHM Communications Corporation plans to introduce Foodday Television, six-day-a-week, one-hour food and cooking packages that it hopes to syndicate to independent television stations around the country.

1984,"   While scouring this city in 1880 for equipment to establish his photography business, George Eastman found a small engine. It cost a little more than he wanted to spend and was a little more powerful than necessary. ''I really need only a one horsepower,'' he said, according to a biographer. ''This is two horsepower, but perhaps business will grow up to it. It's worth a chance; I guess I'll take it.''     The gamble paid off, of course. Mr. Eastman's tiny one-floor factory blossomed into Eastman Kodak, the world's largest manufacturer of photographic films and papers. His inventions, including the box camera, photographic paper and rolled film, made photography the handmaiden of medicine, science, entertainment and education and the rival of movable type as a medium of communication. His success and his philanthropy put this city on the corporate and cultural map. ROCHESTER PINS ITS HOPES ON ANOTHER HIGH-TECH BOOM"

1986,"  After more than a decade of post-Vietnam disarray and nay-saying, Democrats are struggling to build a new foreign policy consensus at a time when some analysts contend that President Reagan and the Republican Party are losing political control in this area.   Even some conservative Democrats have expressed dismay over the President's hostility toward the unratified arms treaty negotiated with the Soviet Union in 1979. And on the question of providing military assistance to the rebels fighting the Sandinista Government of Nicaragua, the President has been unable to rally either public opinion or the Congress behind his latest aid proposal.   As they see signs of Mr. Reagan's faltering on this front, Democrats have begun to lay down a thematic framework for redefining their stance on foreign policy, perhaps the most vexing issue facing the party in its effort to fashion a new political identity before the 1988 election.

2004,"Poor white bread. America's culinary ambassador has gone stale, and Atkins dieters may have driven the maker of Wonder Bread into Chapter 11. The term, synonymous with something middlebrow, is an insult in a culture that celebrates the high and the low. But there is white bread, and then there is white bread. ''It took 50 years for Wonder Bread to come in and out and artisanal bread to come back into style,'' says Amy Scherber, of Amy's Bread. An advocate of healthful whole wheat when she began baking in 1992, she soon saw white's virtues; baguettes and rustic loaves are her best sellers.  ''The blank canvas for a bread baker is to make a perfect white loaf,'' she says. At a recent exhibition in Paris, it was the muse for Jean Paul Gaultier, who had bakers and pattern makers design everything from bâtards to Birkin bags. White bread also inspired the photographer Kevin Van Aelst. For his series ''The Golden Spiral,'' he sliced a piece of Wonder Bread (''iconic of everything American,'' he says) into fractals to explore the philosophical question When does a fish cease to be a fish? Or a loaf cease to be a loaf? When it stops making us hungry . . . that will be the day.   CHRISTINE MUHLKE   Wonder Bread"

1996," Fed Leaves Rates Steady, Cheering Administration  After weeks of speculation that the Federal Reserve would take a pre-emptive strike against inflation, its monetary policy officials decided not to raise interest rates, apparently believing the economy is cooling enough.

This kind of impulsive buying can have disastrous repercussions if the house has a major flaw or defect that's not immediately detectable. While first impressions are important, they should be buttressed by a careful inspection.    When you drive up to a new house, take a few minutes to look at it and the surrounding grounds before going inside. Study the lay of the land. The ground should slope away from the house -- ideally six inches for every three feet-- otherwise rain water will collect around the foundation and eventually seep into the basement. Patios and driveways should also slant away from the house for the same reason. If possible visit the house after a rainstorm. Then, if you see a number of puddles, you'll know that the house has a drainage problem.   Crucial Points for House Inspections"

Like today's bodybuilders, the 1993 Camaro is lean, finely proportioned and powerful. It's a muscle car for the Nineties.""   -- Chevrolet overview of the 1993 Camaro.    I HAVE been prowling through my computer, looking for notes on a conversation that is now more than a decade old. Electrons are amazing, and I actually found what I was looking for.   It turns out that it has been 11 years since that sunny morning when the late Pete Estes and I stood talking in the outdoor dining area of Tavern on the Green in Central Park. Estes was then about to retire as president of General Motors, and he had come to New York to show off his final creation, Chevy's 1982 Camaro.   I remember discussing the crucial need for better fuel economy. The new Camaro was lighter than its predecessor but still heavy enough to have displeased the critics. Estes agreed, noting that the engineers had only scratched the surface.    ""So far, we've done the easy part,"" he said. ""We got rid of the fat. The rest is going to be tougher.""   Aha! And now there is a new Camaro, the fourth generation, exactly 100 pounds heavier than the '82 model, but of the modern ilk, which is to say that it looks nothing like Camaros of the past. In the intervening years technology has taken the place of dieting and, heavier or not, the new car does go farther on a gallon of gas.   I remember expressing surprise, too, during that conversation with Estes, that G.M. had managed to get 10 years out of the same basic model. And his response was this: ""It shows what you can do when you do it right in the first place.""   In fact, the Camaro and its twin, the Pontiac Firebird, have always been exactly right for their markets, sporty cars that could be dressed inexpensively or in go-fast fashion, appealing both to low-end buyers and to hot-rodders. And the Camaro is still right, still with an available V8 engine to burble pleasantly and to drive the rear wheels, still fast even in its conservative standard mode.   The new car competes against the Toyota Celica, Nissan 240SX, Ford Mustang, Eagle Talon, Plymouth Laser and the Mitsubishi Eclipse, among others. According to Chevrolet, 50 percent of the buyers in the sporty-car segment are women, and nearly half of Camaro's principal drivers are female, a figure that drops to 30 percent for the high-end Z28.   Both the Z28 and the standard car are hatchbacks, and the base coupe carries a 160-horsepower V6. The Z28, with a 5.7-liter V8 under its hood, is as always a flat-out performance car, and it will give a Corvette a run for its money.   That is not surprising, of course, since the 5.7-liter power plant is the same basic engine that lives under the Corvette's hood. In the Camaro, it produces 275 horsepower, and its bulk fills the engine compartment.   The new 3.4-liter V6 delivers 20 horsepower more than was available in 1992's standard car, and it sends it to the road through a five-speed manual transmission. The V8 produces 30 more horsepower than last year, and it is coupled to a new six-speed manual. Four-speed automatics are optional with either engine.   For '93, rack-and-pinion steering has replaced the recirculating-ball system of the past in order to improve responsiveness and an ""on-center"" feel. Antilock brakes also are standard.   The fourth generation car was redesigned head to tail, and Chevrolet's literature says that ""all classic Camaro design ingredients are evident."" That is arguable, however, and the new model looks more like a Mitsubishi Eclipse than like anything else.   Part of that, at least in the case of the Z28, has to do with the paint scheme and the upper body. All Z28's have black roofs, and the darkly tinted glass makes the entire ""greenhouse"" look black. What has been retained from the past is the Camaro's tenacious stance, aggressive front end and brawny tires on 16-inch wheels.   The car is smooth but wedge-shaped. It rides on the same 101-inch wheelbase as the '92, but the body is longer, wider and taller. Sideview mirrors are fared into the front fenders, and a spoiler is integrated into the rear hatch. Trim is of the blackout variety, and the headlights nestle in black pockets.   The new Camaro makes extensive use of dent-resistant, rustproof body panels. The roof, doors, hatch and spoiler assembly are made of sheet-molded compound, and the front fenders, and nose and tail pieces also are made of composite material. Rust-resistant two-side galvanized steel is used for the rear quarter panels and hood.   The hatch itself has a very high liftover, leading to a deep well just inside and then to a shallow cargo floor. Luggage capacity is not this car's long suit.   Space also is at a premium in the rear of the redesigned interior, and even small children are likely to complain. On the other hand, the cockpit is comodious, and the new front buckets -- available only in cloth -- are both commodious and supportive.   The black and white Z28 test car had a two-tone gray interior, nicely finished although abundantly plastic. The instrument panel sort of wraps around the driver, and the analog gauges, dominated by a 150-mile per hour speedometer, are easy to read.   A huge door covers a medium-size glove compartment, in which resides the remote button for the rear hatch. The console contains a small ashtray, a single cupholder and a bin whose cover serves as an armrest. The shifter, as always, is topped by a large round knob, now covered with leather.   As tested and loaded with options, the car carried a sticker of $19,098, although the base price for a Z28 is a more reasonable $16,779. The least expensive Camaro goes for $13,399, and the cars will begin arriving in dealerships early in February.   Oddly enough, they are ""imports,"" coming from an assembly plant near Montreal. And they do now feel less like Detroit iron. The bone-jarring ride of the past is gone, as are many of the creaks and rattles that resulted from the huge metal doors. The new Z28 is tighter and a great deal more civilized than its ancestors.   On the road, though, there is still that slingshot acceleration. There is the taut suspension and good handling. And, of course, there is that wonderful rumble of a potent V8.   Like the '82 model that lasted almost unchanged for a decade, the newest Z28 has been named to pace the Indianapolis 500. And with the 77th running of the race on May 30, Chevrolet will set a record. In all, nine Chevies will have led the pack. Four of them, including the 1967 original, have been Camaros. Again -- and at Last -- a New Camaro"

Methodically, it exploited these central European strengths to haul energy and raw materials from Eastern Europe, and to ship its products and skills around the world.   Then came the oil shocks of 1973-74, and Voest began to look beyond steel for lines of business that could help it withstand recession and soaring energy costs.   In 1980, as overcapacity and collapsing prices sparked Europe's worst postwar steel crisis, the company also began to have second thoughts about its ties to Eastern Europe, which in good years accounted for 30 percent of sales. The doubts began to emerge as a series of financial problems shook Poland and Rumania, two of Voest's best customers. VOEST-ALPINE PLANS PRODUCT EXPANSION"

In reply to one of our articles on chocolate, she hastily volunteered a recipe for a ''cake'' that she has chosen to dub a bete noire, or black beast. She calls it that, she said, because her friends find the dessert irresistible, whether served directly from the oven or cooled, with an English custard or without. As for her own preference, she said, ''I love it straight from the oven. It's like a weird souffle.''

1990,"  As a young man with HIV infection, I had my face-to-face confrontation with the grim reaper last April, with a nasty bout of PCP pneumonia. I spent seven weeks in a London hospital (and am now a firm advocate of a national health plan; my hospital bill was paid by the state).    Josephs seems resigned to letting this nasty thing kill him, and it probably will, although I hope not.   I am not a stupid person; I know what the statistics are, but I am not a statistic. I'm a human being with choices, and I choose not to live with this cloud over my head. I believe we can shape our fate. I have to believe that, or I'd have the same grim outlook Josephs does.   HIV has been a more positive influence in my life than a negative one. I'm a more focused, settled person. I have a good, loving relationship, and I am lucky to have a supportive family. Meditation, vitamins, visualization, audio tapes, exercise, good food, good friends (and maybe even acupuncture, if I ever get up the nerve) are all a part of my life now. I keep my eyes and ears open for new and not-so-new treatments and therapies that may enhance my life and make me a healthier and stronger person.   Josephs says the one lesson he has learned from this is that he is powerless -- there is nothing he can do except wait. I say he's wrong.

1982,"  From the lofts along lower Broadway to the Theater of Riverside Church, the small dance companies of New York are renewing the dance. They have distilled from teachers, traditions, varied schools and backgrounds, an art of the present. They are creating rather than repeating. And yet, in an increasingly miserly climate of shrinking funds and redirected priorities, they are struggling against growing odds.   ''These are very difficult times to begin or sustain a dance company,'' said Beverly D'Anne, director of the dance program at the State Council for the Arts, which has traditionally helped fund both large, established and small, promising companies. ''There has been such a huge proliferation of companies, and funding cannot keep up. I don't even think we've seen the roughest yet,'' she said, attributing a pervasive thinning of funds to the example set by the Federal Government. ''The attitude of the arts being the most expendable cause filters down to businesses and corporations, who are now contributing to more socially or politically viable causes. No one in the arts field feels private or corporate funding will fill the gap the Government is leaving.'' DANCE TROUPES TIGHTEN BELTS"

1986,"  THE halt of hyperinflation in Israel is the necessary but not sufficient condition for resumed economic growth.   The sharp cuts in its budget deficits have given Israel the opportunity to restructure its economy from one overwhelmingly dominated by the Government to one in which private investment can provide the thrust for vigorous growth.   During the years of high inflation from 1973 to 1984, Israel's budget deficits averaged 14 percent of the gross national product - a ratio nearly three times as high as that of the big United States deficits during the Reagan years.   Following the adoption of the stabilization program of July 1985, which included cuts in governmental spending and higher taxes, Israel's budget deficit shrank to 3.3 percent during the second half of 1985.

He was imprisoned after being kidnapped by the Chinese police from the Portuguese colony of Macao.

1985,"  THE autumn produce markets are overflowing with an abundance of cruciferous vegetables: Crisp, shiny green and red cabbages; creamy heads of cauliflower; dark purplish-green clusters of broccoli; brussels sprouts, their tall stalks tightly ringed with miniature cabbages; fringed bundles of pink and dark green kale, and pale globes of kohlrabi, looking like objects about to take off into interplanetary flight.   For far too long cruciferous vegetables - members of the cabbage, mustard and turnip families - have suffered from an undeservedly evil reputation. Indeed, in the hands of an uninspired cook, they can be among the most dreadful of all culinary experiences: Overcooked to watery limpness, damp, gray and greasy, too often their sulfurous aromas evoke images of grim kitchens in Orwellian rooming houses.   But inspired cooks are learning that it need not be so. In their hands, these undervalued vegetables can bring fresh challenge and excitement to the dinner table. Moreover, some cancer researchers are suggesting that what many of our parents said may be true: These vegetables are good for us. There is some preliminary evidence that cruciferous vegetables may be effective in the prevention of certain types of cancer. THESE VEGETABLES MERIT MORE PRAISE AND LESS BOILING"

1992,"  CANCER of the prostate is unquestionably a disease of older men. It is rare in men under 50, but by the age of 65 to 70 nearly one man in seven has a detectable prostate cancer that could someday threaten his life. Now second only to lung cancer as a cause of cancer deaths and second only to skin cancer as a diagnosis among men, prostate cancer will eventually strike 1 man in 11 in this country.   But as this disease becomes more common as well as more deadly, medical scientists are questioning whether age and a rising life expectancy alone are the reasons for the grim statistics. They point to the fact that in most Asian countries, prostate cancer is rare. But in postwar Japan, which has experienced striking changes in living and eating habits, the rates have been rising. And when Asian immigrants move to a country where the rates are high, their risk of developing prostate cancer rises. Personal Health"

1984,"  THE scores of Soviet writers who have found their way to the West in the last decade were evidently accompanied by their Slavic muse. Most of them continue to write in Russian about Russia, to associate with other emigres and to lament what they believe is a lack of understanding among Americans about the nature of the Soviet regime.    That concern came through forcefully in recent interviews with three novelists now living on the East Coast, whose work has made an impact here and abroad in the last few months. They are Vasily Aksyonov, author of ''The Island of Crimea,'' published by Random House, a political fantasy about an independent Crimea trying to survive in the shadow of Soviet power; Sergei Dovlatov, author of ''The Compromise,'' a takeoff on Soviet journalism published by Alfred A. Knopf, and Yuz Aleshkovsky, whose novel ''Kangaroo,'' a surrealistic satire about the Soviet secret police, appeared in France last year to favorable reviews and is due to be published in this country in July by Farrar, Straus & Giroux.

1985,"  COSTAS FERRIS'S ''Rembetiko'' has a firmer place in the annals of Greek musicology than it does in filmdom, since it is primarily an attempt to trace the origins of the dolorous, Eastern-influenced popular music for which it is named. Along the way, the film attempts to dramatize some important events in 20th-century Greek history and to offer a biography of a famous rembetiko singer named Marika Ninou. It is least successful when it tries to commingle all three of these threads, since it does this in such a confused and fancifully meandering style. It works best when the characters, all of them musicians, simply play and sing. SCREEN: 'REMBETIKO'"

2001," For Men Only      It was close to 10 years ago that men's magazines began to chronicle a phenomenon that would soon enter the cultural vernacular as the era of male vanity. In this new world -- so advertiser-friendly -- men tended to their tan lines and searched for 10-ply cashmere as fetishistically as their wives, daughters and girlfriends did. They primped; they groomed; they made an enemy of rigatoni.    And yet, strangely enough, men had no analogue for the experience so many women refer to as ''going behind the Red Door.'' Until now. No, Elizabeth Arden has not opened a branch of its Red Door salon for men, but a few weeks ago a ruddy-faced Frenchman named Philippe Dumont arrived in New York to open a spa that, as his press material puts it, maintains only one rule: no women allowed.

In another budget area, Congress today added $5.5 billion to Federal spending in the current fiscal year. President Reagan agreed to sign the compromise bill, which was approved in a stongly bipartisan vote, after vetoing two previous versions as inflationary.

Four years ago, Mr. Reagan swept into office pledging to eliminate waste in the Pentagon and protect whistle-blowers. Now, on the eve of the election, he claims that he has kept that promise. To prove it, earlier this month, he staged a ceremony in the Rose Garden to honor as ''the unsung heroes of peace'' 12 auditors who had discovered such things as faulty wing bolts on B-52 bombers and defective parachute cords.

Bob Bourne, skating in a routine drill, was knocked unconscious by a steaming Stefan Persson shot and required 21 stitches to close a gash in his scalp.    Bourne, carried from the Nassau Coliseum ice by stretcher, had regained consciousness and was joking later when he left for Nassau Hospital in Mineola with his head heavily bandaged. Dr. Vince DiGregorio, a plastic surgeon, closed Bourne's wound, but Al Arbour, the Islander coach, said it was unlikely that the veteran forward would play Friday night against the Rangers at Madison Square Garden.    The injury came slightly more than 24 hours after Paul Boutilier, the defenseman, was similarly cut during practice and needed 66 stitches to close a gash on his forehead.

1981,"  According to a routine by the Royal Canadian Air Farce, a popular comedy troupe, ''Some nationalities look at things as they are and say, 'Why?' A Canadian looks at things as they might be and says, 'No way!' '' And so it seemed last week as Canada experienced another of its periodic constitutional convulsions.   It was occasioned by Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau's plan - against the opposition of eight of Canada's 10 provinces - to bring home from Great Britain the Canadian constitution and the right to amend it, at the same time establishing a bill of rights binding on Federal and provincial governments alike. The changes would significantly affect the balance of power between Ottawa and the provinces. What caused last week's uproar was Canada's Supreme Court decision concerning Mr. Trudeau's attempt to seek the changes without the unanimous consent of the powerful provinces.

The ceremonies will be in The Admiral Nimitz State Historical Park, Fredericksburg, Tex., the town of his birth 100 years ago.   Appointed to the United States Naval Academy at the age of 15, Fleet Admiral Nimitz graduated with distinction in 1905. He was chief of the United States Navy's Bureau of Navigation when the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor on Dec. 7, 1941. He so impressed Secretary of the Navy Frank Knox during frequent consultations following the attack that he appointed Nimitz as Commander of the Pacific Fleet.   He quickly made his mark at the Battle of Midway in June 1942, when his positioning of aircraft carriers enabled United States bombers to sink four Japanese carriers and allowed the Allies to shift to the offensive. In the Battles of the Philippine Sea and Leyte Gulf, Fleet Admiral Nimitz's ships drastically reduced the size and power of the Japanese Navy.

1963,"DINO RISI, the Italian writer-director known here only for ""Poor But Beautiful"" (""Poveri Ma Belli""), shown in New York five years ago, has improved immensely to judge by ""The Easy Life"" (""Il Sorpasso""), which arrived at the Festival Theater yesterday. For his examination of an aimless wastrel and his destructive effect on an idealistic youngster and others, he merely touches on his flight from responsibility in a seemingly simple and obvious, yet sensitive commentary on what certainly are universal faults.Call this a comedy-drama in which the comedy is only a surface symptom. Basically, Mr. Risi and his scenarists are telling the story of Bruno, a youthful but middle-aged happy-go-lucky type, who adores his fast white roadster as much as he does the girls and the self-indulgent life it symbolizes. This is also the story of Roberto, an ill-fated serious, Caspar Milquetoast-type of Roman law student who is drawn, quite casually, into Bruno's swift orbit for two days during which he loses not only his perspectives and ideals but also his life.It starts, quite innocently, when the older man, Bruno, is invited to use Roberto's phone and he cavalierly invites the young man out for a drink. It is summer and the only care Bruno seems to have is the next turn in the road and the next girl. The breakneck journey takes the pair from one spa to the next, with each stop proving an intellectual jolt to Roberto, who slowly discovers that his companion is a cadger, a braggart and an iconoclast who is ready to expose even the skeletons in the closets of the relatives Roberto reveres. And our hurtling hero is exposed also by his own estranged family and his shady deals so that even he intermittently admits his faults and his gnawing loneliness.In creating this upper middle-class ""La Dolce Vita,"" Mr. Risi has given us a quick jaunt through the Italian Riviera, as well as his perceptive views of life among the vacationing bourgeois.The views and the girls are extremely photogenic and the headlong dash toward fun and games would appear to be obvious and somewhat pointless if they did not add up to a dramatic whole.But Mr. Risi's fast-paced direction and, more important, the truths he underlines, give his uncluttered film meaning and poignancy as well as mere speed. He is fortunate in his principals, too. Vittorio Gassman makes a superbly brash, coarse, hail-fellow-well-met Bruno who, in one of his rare moments of honest sadness, warns Roberto away from his ""easy life"" because ""I've never had a real friend."" As the diffident, introspective Roberto, Jean-Louis Trintignant, who has been seen here in a variety of French films, is excellent as his opposite number, an impressionable youngster whose shame and fears finally turn to admiration of his strange friend's ""easy life.""Catherine Spaak is both cute and wise as Mr. Gassman's teen-age daughter. Luciana Angiolillo, as his estranged wife who long ago discovered his frailties, is both handsome and forceful. And Linda Sini and Corrado Olmi, as Mr. Trintignant's rustic relatives, add touching portraits to an impressive gallery.The English subtitles miss quite a bit of the earthy humor and patois of the Italian dialogue, but that is a minor defect. This unpretentious focus on ""The Easy Life"" results in compassionate and memorable drama. Dino Risi's 'The Easy Life,' Italian Comedy-Drama, Arrives"
1995,"  Usually dark on Sundays, the Metropolitan Opera House was as brightly lit as ever two nights ago. The Met orchestra and chorus crowded this big stage; elegant tables were set in the foyers upstairs, and Luciano Pavarotti, June Anderson and James Levine were there for a long and interesting concert to benefit the company's pension fund.   Mr. Pavarotti, the picture of tenorial exuberance, made a strange partner for the hard-hitting Ms. Anderson. The tenor's smothering embraces and random smooches during and between duet numbers made the American diva noticeably uncomfortable, if not downright embarrassed. It would also have been interesting to take Ms. Anderson's temperature as Mr. Pavarotti stood behind her and mugged during the soprano solos of their ""Traviata"" encore.

Although restrictions on news reporting made it difficult to judge with certainty, a situation close to martial law prevailed in the country's black townships, and it appeared that the authorities had contained or at least muffled the signs of black anger, if only for the time being.   But as the South African security apparatus enforced its will at home, the pace of efforts in Europe and in the United States to impose economic penalties on the Pretoria Government was quickening. Although the push for sanctions was a reponse to the state of emergency imposed a week ago by President P. W. Botha of South Africa, it has also served to isolate President Reagan and Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of Britain, who are resisting further penalties.

1984,"  The play had stopped early in the second half of the game between the United States men's Olympic basketball team and a collection of National Basketball Association players Friday night, and Bobby Knight had a point to make.    He had already made several observations, in various tones, to the referees, Charley Vacca and John Dabrow. But after Vern Fleming, the Olympian from Long Island City, was charged with what appeared to be a routine offensive foul, Knight rose from his chair in the Milwaukee Arena, moved along the sideline toward midcourt, and gestured to Michael Jordan, who happened to be holding the basketball. Jordan, who appreciates a smart pass when he sees one, followed directions and tossed the ball to his coach.   That is when Knight demonstrated the fundamental truth behind the United States effort to regain the gold medal that had been given up in the boycott of 1980: It's his ball.

1970,"""Five Easy Pieces,"" which played last night at Philharmonic Hall (the one American fiction movie in the regular events of this year's Film Festival) and opens today at the Coronet Theater, is the second feature of Bob Rafelson, a young director whose name will probably not be remembered in connection with his first film, ""Head.""""Head"" suffered from its cast, the Monkees, and from an ad campaign that perhaps did more for the publicist than for the client (you may recall a month when New York was inundated with mysterious poster - photographs of John Brockman's head), but it was a better movie than most critics allowed — largely because it had at least as many ideas as it had technical resources and because it kept turning its excesses into playful but responsible style. ""Head"" was a movie that had nowhere to go except down, but in retrospect, doesn't seem all that bad.I'm not sure how ""Five Easy Pieces"" will seem in retrospect—perhaps not all that good. It has its own red-herring equivalent to John Brockman's head—in the form of a title that everybody seems to find terribly provocative but that refers more logically to piano pieces for the beginner. And it has a trip—north to Alaska—which is part of a fairly elaborate central metaphor. And it is full of ideas, and a style—in this case, a rigorously deliberate and plain style—that is not less insistent than the canny exuberance of ""Head.""""Five Easy Pieces"" is an open-ended story, like much recent American fiction, satiric in thrust (notice the names in the cast of characters) and elegiac in mood, about a young California oil worker (Jack Nicholson) who travels up to his family's island home on Puget Sound where he sees his dying father, makes a sexual conquest, and visits his past—before heading further north.By inclination the young man is very rootless-contemporary-American, with a country-and-Western loving mistress (Karen Black), beer in the refrigerator, and nights out at the bowling alley. But his family is well-off, musical and eccentric; his brother and sister (Ralph Waite and Lois Smith) concertize; and he himself has given up a career—more or less in the name of aimless integrity. Before he seduces his brother's fiancée (Susan Anspach), he plays for her—an easy piece—but scorns her reaction: ""I faked a little Chopin. You faked a little response.""Something of this exchange carries into my feeling about ""Five Easy Pieces,"" which at first appears to be rich with a quantity of felt life, but on reflection seems both more carefully studied and more coldly casual than profoundly understood. In all non-essentials it is movie-making of a very high order. But scene by scene I find myself moving from sympathy, to admiration, to respect—for a performance, for Laslo Kovacs's evocative photography, or merely for the superior quality of the color film used in capturing the soft, wet lovely ambience of the Pacific Northwest.The acting is generally good, but except for Karen Black's pathetically appealing vulgarian, it lives in bits and pieces, rather than in a quality of sustained characterization. Almost everybody in ""Five Easy Pieces"" is a caricature but plays for all-round sentiment, and in context the one pointedly funny single-dimension role (Helena Kallianiotes as a tough Lesbian hitchhiker on her way to Alaska to escape America's accumulated filth) looks like a tour de force.""Five Easy Pieces"" is built around a series of good-bys. As the central character divests himself of responsibilities, of people and possessions, finally of the coat off his back (rather too pointedly—just before hitching his own symbolic ride North) the film grows heavy with a kind of poignancy that for all its understatement leans heavily on a stock of quite unearned response.Rafelson is expert at supporting this movement, and the film proceeds from scene to scene with a quiet competent modernism that bespeaks quality, but that more often begs than provides expression. Greater things seem always to be in the offing. But I think they are an illusion. ""Five Easy Pieces"" is a film that takes small risks and provides small rewards.

A rippled glass and shellacked mahogany divider separates a 50-foot Art Deco bar from the dining area.

1984,"  Neil Jenney has been called a political artist but while the subject he addresses, landscape, has indeed been politicized, his interest in it seems more that of a moralist than a manipulator.    Not that the artist doesn't have a knack for grabbing his audience - painting in a realistic style that's getting ever more dewy and always making a production out of his frames. No one has ever used frames more effectively than Jenney: broad, molded and generally painted black, they make peep shows out of the images they enclose and, invariably, they are inscribed with boldly lettered titles. Most of the time these dispel any ambiguities that may exist in the painting, but like all good packaging, they also add mystery and glamour. ART: EXHIBITION OF NEIL JENNEY WORK"

1986,"  THE CHINA CARD. By John Ehrlichman. 523 pages. Simon & Schuster. $18.95. John Ehrlichman's ''China Card'' is a suspense thriller about the rapprochement between the United States and China that was effected by President Nixon and his national security adviser, Henry A. Kissinger, in 1971 and 1972. Where, you may wonder, is the suspense in this, since we know from the outset that Mr. Nixon will end up going to Peking? Where is the thrill?   Aha! What you didn't know is that in the autumn of 1966, a young graduate of Harvard Law School named Matthew Thompson went to work for the law firm of Nixon, Mudge, Rose, Guthrie & Alexander. Through his father, an Orientalist at Whittier College, Matt Thompson knew Richard Nixon, who was gearing up to run for the Presidency in 1968. Also through his father, Matt had contact with certain key people in the circle of China's leadership who began to cultivate him as a secret lobbyist in the Nixon camp. Matt was willing because he deeply believed that the United States and China should be friends once again. East-West Intrigue"

1982,"  ALTHOUGH the differences between contemporary pop-soul music and swing are enormous, there also is a striking continuity between these traditions. As Quincy Jones, the producer-arranger who won five Grammy awards last week, points out, dance music at the height of the disco boom and dance music during the peak years of swing, share a solid ''four-to-the-floor'' beat.   This continuity between classic swing and modern pop-soul, which is spiritual as well as rhythmic, will be on display Sunday night at 8 o'clock at Radio City Music Hall, where an impressive array of jazz, soul, and pop artists, including Mr. Jones, will gather in an allstar tribute to Count Basie. Mr. Basie, 77 years old, will not only be honored but he will also conduct his orchestra and play piano. The pop-soul singer Dionne Warwick and Las Vegas entertainer Wayne Newton will be co-hosts. Other guests include Stevie Wonder, Joe Williams, Lena Horne, James Ingram, Oscar Peterson, Teresa Brewer and the Copasetics tap-dancing quintet.

""When a player produces as he has, he doesn't deserve a cut.""   Mattingly's previous record of $1,975,000 was set in 1987. Andre Dawson, Lonnie Smith and Benito Santiago all failed in their attempts to break the record before Joyner prevailed.   Joyner will be eligible for free agency following this season. Watkins refused to speculate what the first baseman will do come next fall.   ""It's up to Wally in the long run,"" Watkins said. ""But he's been with the Angels five years and longer than that in the minors. He'll have to weigh all the factors."" . . . Dickie Thon will be paid $1.25 million to play shortstop this season by the Philadelphia Phillies after losing his arbitration bid. The 32-year-old Thon, who hit .255 in 141 games last season, was seeking $1.7 million for the season and argued his case before Reginald Alleyne for four hours in Los Angeles on Friday.   The Phillies have won all four arbitration cases they have ever been involved in. Big Numbers For Joyner"

1982,"  THE Supreme Court of the United States is scheduled to hear oral arguments today in the case of Amy Rowley, a deaf fourth grader from Peekskill, N.Y., to decide whether public school systems may be required to provide sign language interpreters in the classroom.   Educators across the nation are looking to the case for a definition of what Congress meant in 1975 when it passed a law requiring all school districts to provide a ''free appropriate public education'' to handicapped children.   Does an ''appropriate'' education mean one that enables a child to become, as a Federal District Court posed the issue, ''a functioning member of society''? Or does it mean giving a handicapped child such as Amy, who had been performing in the top half of her class when her parents requested an interpreter, what the court called ''an opportunity to achieve his full potential''?   The case comes when educators throughout the nation are grappling with the practical implications of the law, the Education for All Handicapped Children Act, which called for sweeping changes in the instruction of handicapped children, who have been long neglected by school systems.

1984,"  Boat fishing for Lake Ontario's lake trout and brown trout has remained excellent all summer, says Ron Gervaise of the Salmon River Sports Shop in Pulaski, N.Y. He says that a few chinook and coho salmon have also been taken.    Fishing is limited to boats because at this time of year the species named have gone deep to avoid the superheated layer of surface water. In recent days, that layer has been from 76 to 80 degrees.   The lake's charter-boat captains all use so-called downriggers to get the trolled lure down to the required depth, which is sometimes 50 feet or more below the surface. A downrigger is nothing more than a heavy weight lowered to that depth. The line and lure, which are attached to it, pull free when a fish strikes. An advantage of the downrigger is that one can run his lure at the precise depth wanted on a relatively short length of line. Planing devices will also get a lure down, but much more line is needed, and the same is true of wire or lead core line. Nonetheless, Mr. Gervaise notes, there are many who catch fish without the benefit of the downrigger. TROUT DEEP IN LAKE ONTARIO"
